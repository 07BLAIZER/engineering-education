### Commit Message
Write a short commit message with a description and you can choose to commit to the master branch or work from dedicated branches, (completely up to you as you get more comfortable using Github). Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY&t=577s) 
on how Github Branches work.

You should be able to see your .md file and an alert that says your branch is (X) commit ahead of section.io:master (bottom green arrow). 

Now click **New pull request** to create a PR (pull request) for review and approval by the Section team (top green arrow).
