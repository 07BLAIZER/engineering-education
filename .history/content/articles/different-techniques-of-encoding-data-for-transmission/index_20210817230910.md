# Data Encoding techniques
In a communication network, data is transmitted from the sender to the receiver. For this data to be transmitted properly it is encoded into binary digits 0s and 1s.
This article intends to cover more on how data to be transmitted through a network is encoded. This therefore will emphasize more on different data encoding techniques. It also touches on ..-  Digital and analog data.
The different data encoding techniques that shall be focused on include; Non-Return to Zero Level, Non-Return to Zero, Non-Return to Zero Inverted, Bi-phase encoding, and Block encoding. Data encoding types shall also be discussed.
For this data to be encoded it has to be converted to signal variations. This signal variations include;
- Analog data to analog signal conversion – This includes Amplitude Modulation, Phase Modulation, and Frequency Modulation.
- Digital data to Analog signals − Modulation techniques include;
1. Amplitude Shift Keying
2. Frequency Shift Keying
3.  Phase Shift Keying

- Digital data to analog signals – This is what we are going to discuss in this article.
The types of encoding techniques include
1.	Non Return to Zero
2.	Bi-phase encoding
3.	Block encoding


## Non-Return to Zero
In this encoding technique;
High voltages are represented by 1s.
Low voltages are represented by 0s.
During bit interval, voltages remain the main. This is the main behavior of this encoding technique.
There is no indication for the beginning and the ending of a bit. Due to no voltage change during bit interval, there is no difference in the value of the previous and present bit.

The above diagram shows the NRZ encoding techniques.
The main disadvantage of NRZ is that the long voltage level causes the loss of clock synchronization and hence the receiver is not able to differentiate between 0s and 1s.
 The two types of NRZ encoding include;
-	Non Return to Zero level
-	Non Return to Zero Inverted

### Non-Return to Zero level (NRZ-L)
There is a change in polarity, if the incoming signal changes from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1.
The first input signal should always have a change in polarity.

### Non-Return to Zero Inverted
There is a transition at the beginning of the bit interval if a 1 occurs as the incoming signal.
The main disadvantage of the NRZ encoding is that there is a disturbance in clock synchronization between the transmitter clock and the receiver clock.
## Bi-phase encoding
There is double checking of the signal.
Signals are checked at the beginning and in the middle.
Due to double checking of the signal; the rate of the clock is twice the rate of data transfer.
The clock synchronization is taken from the signal hence the it requires a greater bandwidth.
We have Differential Manchester encoding and Bi-phase Manchester.

###	Differential Manchester
In Differential Manchester, a transition occurs at the middle of the bit interval.
If a transition occurs at the beginning of the bit interval, it means that the input signal was 0 and there is no transition if the input signal is 1.

###	Bi-phase Manchester
Here, transition is done in the middle of the bit interval.
Resultant pulse of the transition is from high to low when input is 1 in the middle and vice versa for input 0.

	The figure below shows the waveforms of NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Bi-phase Manchester and Differential Manchester coding for different digital inputs.

## Block encoding.
Includes 4B/5B and 8B/6T encoding techniques.
### 4B/5B encoding technique.
Like in Manchester encoding, clocks with double speed are required to send data.
In this type of encoding, double speed clocks are not required rather 4 bits of codes are mapped to 5 bits having 1 bit minimum in the group.
Double speed clocks are avoided by assigning 5 bits in place of 4 consecutive 4 bits which are pre-determined in a dictionary.
In selecting 5 bit code, there should be one leading 0 and no more than two trailing 0s. Hence, transmission occur as a block of bit.
### 8B/6T encoding technique
Two voltages have been used to send data in the previously described encoding techniques but what if we use more voltages like 3 volts or more? Can we send more data? The answer is yes.
For example, if we use 6 volts levels as a representation of 8 bits for a single signal, we term the type of encoding of as 8B/6T encoding.
This means that we can have as many as 15625 5<sup>6</sup> combinations and 65536 4<sup>8</sup> and combinations for bits.

The techniques discussed above are used for converting digital data into digital signals by using coding or compressing for reliable transmission of data.

## Conclusion;
This article enlightens readers for a better understanding of Bi-phase encoding, Block encoding and Non Return to zero encoding.
The reader should be able to understand the different types of Bi-phase encoding both differential Manchester and Bi-phase Manchester and be able to encode a message in both the two types.
The reader should be able to know the demerits of the Non return to zero encoding and know a good method to encode a message for transmission i.e, Block encoding,
