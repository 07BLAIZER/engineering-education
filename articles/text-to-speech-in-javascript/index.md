The Web Speech API is used to incorporate voice data into web apps. In this tutorial, we will build a simple webpage that uses the Web Speech API to implement text to speech.

You can check the browser compatibility for the Web Speech API [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API#Browser_compatibility.).

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have:

- A basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

- A code editor. I'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

- A browser to view the webpage, preferably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

### Get the Starter Code
To focus more on text to speech, I've prepared a gist for the HTML file. You can copy it [from here](https://gist.github.com/zolomohan/4115e5399f6770f7e74ab235b78ef6ed) on GitHub.

You can take a look at the final code in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zolomohan/text-to-speech). I've also deployed the project [here](https://zolomohan.github.io/text-to-speech/).

In the starter code, I've set up an empty select menu, a text area to type, and control buttons for the speech. I've used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style the webpage.
