### Introduction
[Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn) is a JavaScript environment used to develop high-performance applications that are scalable and handles multiple I/O operations. E-commerce systems involve several modules working together. Each module, with its complexities, makes Node.js perfect for developing such a system.
### Advantages of building with Node.js

**Performance** - Node.js gives better results with comparatively lower costs as it supports multitasking. It is convenient compared to other languages since an e-commerce store involves several operations such as adding items to the cart, changing the item features, choosing preferred payment options. From the performance point of view, the technology to be used has to serve such tasks efficiently, and Node.js does this effectively due to its ability to handle different operations simultaneously, thus making it a good choice for an online store.

**Scalability** - Online stores keep growing over short periods, making scalability essential when deciding which platform to use for development. On the other hand, Node.js has an inbuilt mechanism that enables it to scale, and the developer can change the system according to the need.

**Big and Active Community** – Node.js constantly keeps improving due to their vast communities consisting of active and vibrant developers. With their cooperation, a well-documented [framework](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-frameworks) has been developed, making app development easier and faster. They have also contributed to the release of ready solutions and code snippets. If one encounters a problem, a high chance is the solution already exists from the same community.

**The benefit of the plugins and packages** - Node.js comes with many packages and plugins applied to most apps. That way, the developers do not need to write a program from scratch but can use open source solutions. It significantly reduces the time of development. It also comprises packages for e-commerce.

**Frontend and Backend Language** - Popular frontend frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), [Ember](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/), and [Angular](https://angular.io/tutorial) use Node.js language. Node.js language can create applications that can run on the frontend and backend. The development process is made easy because there is clear communication between front and back end teams since they understand the two [codebases](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23962/codebase) better. Also, the development team can be smaller and more efficient. In scaling up, recruiting new team members with no much technological diversity will be easier.

**Real-Time Communication and Easy Management** – Real-time interaction with the customer for an e-commerce store is essential. Since Node.js supports frontend and backend development, it is practical to implement a chat-based platform/tool, whereby the interaction with clients will be instant and communication made easy. With the use of the [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) database that Node.js supports, the management of product listing is simplified, and the e-commerce admin can find it convenient to manage products whether from it is from a single vendor or multivendor platform.

**Data Streaming** – With Node.js, HTTP requests and responses are processed as continuous data streams instead of considered isolated events. It ensures better processing and faster load times. It is essential for e-commerce since data streaming ensures faster uploads and hence better interactions.

**Non-Blocking Code Execution –** Node.js platform is built to handle asynchronous I/O and manage the process without any delay, which means it does away with the possibility of any delay in execution. It is not the case compared to synchronous code execution where execution is sequential, meaning one thread cannot execute unless the previous one is finished. It would bring delay in overall execution and hence more response time. In an e-commerce store, each customer request should be handled simultaneously instead of sequentially as many clients are accessing the store simultaneously. Node.js handles this correctly since it allows simultaneous processing.

### Platforms that use Node.js to build an E-Commerce Store
Here are the few ready solutions that create E-commerce app:

**Prime Fusion** – This is based on a JavaScript framework that includes MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, Node.js, GraphQL, webpack React, Gulp, Babel Mocha. The databases and frameworks mentioned above provide the developers with the required tools to build an online store. Prime Fusion does not require special knowledge about building a store since it is backed with the framework.

**Reaction Commerce** – This platform is built on the Meteor framework, a fast, flexible, and scalable solution that works well with npm, Docker, and React. The platform codebase is modular, meaning that it can be customized to meet the developer's needs. The platform provides real-time analytics to assist the users in making better business decisions. 

**Trader io** – This is also built on the MEAN stack. It offers flexible and scalable API and has basic functionalities e-commerce store needs. The developers had previously created several e-commerce applications, and they took the existing code and made it open source.

### What to consider on whether to use Node.js
A few factors can be considered on whether to use Node.js as a preferred development solution. Some of them include:

**Choosing the right solution** - They are ready-made solutions that use Node.js to choose from, as mentioned above. It depends on the user's needs, the number of features the system should have, and its complexity. Also, one can build the app from scratch depending on the unique feature the app is intended to have that ready-made solutions are missing.

**Technology Coherence** - Node.js only serves as a backend for an e-commerce store; other technologies can be considered when building other application parts to avoid any problems that may appear when developing the app. It is better to use a ready package offered by e-commerce platforms, as earlier discussed, to ensure that all the frameworks and solutions remain consistent.
### Conclusion
In many cases, Node.js gives higher performance than other technologies. Node.js makes the development process faster and easier with ready-made frameworks, making it a better solution for building an e-commerce store. E-commerce stores are growing, and stiff competition is becoming a reality; hence there is a need for a robust, reliable, and secured platform to be successful in it. As per the benefits Node.js offers, this is the perfect way to go.
