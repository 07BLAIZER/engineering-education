The engineering field has evolved rapidly over the past couple of years. Physical models are developed to show the final product design model. Today, engineering relies on software and machine tools. In the design process, engineers use the following techniques;

- Computer-assisted design – It is technology in design and technical documentation. It involves the creation of computer models guided by geometrical parameters.
- Computational fluid dynamics – It is used in design to check agreement with the standards and structural integrity.
- Finite-element analysis – It is a tool for the product design process to make development analysis and ensure prompt implementation of analysis results.

However, despite reliance on those techniques, engineers are still in charge of the design process. There is a new trend of artificial intelligence and innovations emergence, leading to system automation. The article will show the engineers' importance in the design process and the engineer's future.

### System design

It is the process of defining architecture, modules, and components and aligning their interface with the data system to the project's specifications. A systemic approach is essential for a coherent and well-running system. In system design, a designer uses modeling languages for information and knowledge expression. Design can be either graphical or textual modeling languages.

#### Elements of a system

The below are primary elements of a system;

- Architecture – It is the backbone of a system, defines the structure, behavior, and view of a course.
- Modules – Smallest units in a system, each is handling a specific task. Several modules together make a system.
- Components – They are made up of modules; they provide a particular group function.
- Interfaces – Boundaries upon which components share information and relate.
- Data – A collection of facts and information.

#### Significant tasks performed during the design process.

- Initialize design definition – It is the planning stage; the designer identifies and determines the technologies to be used on the project.
- Design Characteristics – It is the stage for defining each system element's architecture and characteristics; also, the definition of the viability.
- Alternatives for obtaining system elements
- Managing the design

### [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/artificial-intelligence-future/)

It is human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like a machine like a human and their actions. A computer uses machine learning to determine how they respond to these situations.

### Real applications of AI in design systems

#### Website development

The use of tools like Tobii Pro Sprint, web-based eye-tracking technology, is used in developing websites. It allows UX designers to record website users' eye movements, thereby assisting in improving website design.

The grid is the first company to offer the website design within minutes. The websites are custom AI-designed. After The Grid, many other companies have emerged with the same AI-designed websites, such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

With AI technology, one only needs to upload the data content; and build the website from the ground within minutes.

The same technology is used in design logos by the [Turbologo](https://turbologo.com/?ref=hackernoon.com). One need only upload the brand name, colors, and other preferences, and the logo is generated within minutes.

#### Automation of legwork

Technology can easily automate most of the designer tasks. Using AI, tasks like cropping images and correcting colors can be easily be automated. [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/intelligent-services.html?ref=hackernoon.com) is a design tool that uses intelligent features. It assists the designers to perform work more efficiently and faster. Adobe Sensei identifies patterns in the image, edit, or even creates a new scene.

Another example is Netflix, which uses [augmented intelligence](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-extended-reality/) system for artwork personalization. When the need arises to create multiple banners, designers only need to look at the robot's banners to accept or reject them.

#### DesignScape

It is a system that helps in the design process by aiding in suggestions such as changes in position, scale, and elements.

It assists the website designers with suggestions to create near-perfect websites. It doesn't design the website on its own, though it improves the designer's efficiency. Using it reduces maintenance efforts and time taken to complete the task.

#### [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/)

It uses machine learning to generate font combinations. Assists designers in choosing the best font combination. A person needs just to set different fonts; once done, click generate button. The page will load and will generate a new font combination.

### Benefits of using AI in design systems

- AI assist the designer in creating design more quickly. It can also suggest alternatives and report how they can improve the design.
- AI assists the designer to customize and personalize designs more effectively. Different brands can be designed and using AI, and they can distribute to thousands of users based on their preferences and experiences. AI generates millions of unique versions, new sites, and media found on the user profile.
- AI assists in facial recognition and computer vision. It is helpful to the designers to have a wide range of characteristics of users like gender, age, location, context, and mood.
- It is possible to couple AI with voice recognition, which helps UX designers create more convenient and personalized experiences.
- AI assists in data analysis, thereby helping designers have a wide range of information on user metrics.

### Conclusion

AI is essential as far as the engineering field is concerned. There has been a concern arising after all the automation, whether AI is replacing the engineers. The answer is no, but the AI will assist a lot the engineers with most of the technical work. AI in systems design will be of great importance and will even be of a great revolution in the future.
