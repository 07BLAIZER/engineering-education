C++ is a high-level object oriented programming language with a faster run time than most programming languages since it is closer to the machine level. Recent advancement in machine learning and other artificial intelligence related facets has been seen to be implemented using python due to it's flexibility and rich library support as well as an active community of users.
Why am I vouching for C++ you would ask? C++ is the first language most programmers learnt while starting their journey and thus discarding it along the way without exploiting its full functionality doesn't sit right with me. Irregardless, C++ is still being taught in most universities as a foundational programming language for computer science and other related courses.
C++ has a faster run time as compared to other programming languages and thus suitable for machine learning since fast and reliable feedback is essential in machine learning. C++ also has a rich library support which are used in machine learning which we will get to later.

### Goal
The goal of this tutorial is to educate the user on how to implement machine learning algorithms using the C++ programming language. Since this is an introductory part we will implement the algorithms from scratch to foster understanding and thus it would be much easier when we start with libraries.

### Prerequisites
To follow along this tutorial, the learner should  meet the following minimum requirements.
- Basic understanding of programming in C++ and the use of objects in storing big data.
- A pre-installed IDE, prefferably [Codeblocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries).
- A good mathematical background to be able to understand the statistical methods to be used.

### What is Machine learning?
Machine learning is a facet of artificial intelligence. It reffers to the ability of computer systems to independently find solutions to problems by recognizing patterns of data stored in a database.Initial input of humans is required to write the algorithms to be used by the computer system and also collecting the data and putting it into datasets. Afterwards the machine learns independently and is able to find solutions.

### Implementation of the statistical and mathematical methods for machine learning in C++
Before we embark on writing the code,we need to understand the approach we will be using. In Machine learning we use two mathematical approaches to enable our system learn, namely:-
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
