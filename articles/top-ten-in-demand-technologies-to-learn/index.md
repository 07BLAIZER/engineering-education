Technology is evolving fast. IT professionals are keeping themselves updated with the current trends. 
As an IT professional, it is almost like a survival tactic to keep yourself updated with the ever-evolving technologies and market trends. This means deciding what you want in the future, the jobs you qualify to do, and the [skills you need to gather](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article).

Technology has helped out in almost every aspect of life. It is changing the world at a tremendous rate and advancing towards making it a better place to live in. Technology has come a long way in recent decades. It's development has paved the way for expanding the world's outlook leading to some groundbreaking innovations.

Here are ten technologies in-demand that enable IT professionals to gain skills.

### 1. Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence or AI is the simulation of intelligence in programmed computer systems to mimic their actions perform tasks such as object recognition, voice recognition, facial recognition, decision-making, and patterns. AI can perform these tasks more quickly and accurately than human beings. AI to pertains machines working and behaving like humans or acting like humans.

AI is being used in almost every business sector to reduce human intervention. In cybersecurity, it detects breaches and increases security analyst's efficiency. It also reduces the time they spend analyzing fake positives, and improves productivity.

AI, in simpler terms, means automation. Automation creates more jobs as well as do away with them. 
According to [Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article). Automation will get rid of 73 million jobs and create 23 million jobs. The jobs created by AI will be development, programming, testing, support, and maintenance.

### 2. Cyber Security
Cybersecurity is a significant concern for most companies. Learning Cyber Security gives you the know-how to protect networks, computers from [cyber-attacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-technology-trends-that-you-can-learn-in-2020/).
It also gives technical skills necessary to prevent malicious individuals from destroying data.
Top organizations increase security budgets year over year to stop malicious threats, cyber-attacks, remove vulnerabilities, defend against security breaches, and protect their data from data breaches, data manipulation, and data theft.

Learning cybersecurity will be very beneficial to any developers because cybersecurity jobs are in demand,; security jobs are more than other tech fields. This is evidence that more cybersecurity professionals are needed.

### 3. UI/UX Design
User Interface and User Experience design, or UI/UX design. It is a design-centric approach that offers practical skills. A UI designers concern is about how the product appears. UI designers design interfaces for web apps and mobile apps to be visually appealing. Also, have a good flow, and enable users to navigate easily. UX designer is more concerned about how the product feels. They do research and test element behaviors on the interface to make sure that the [flow is good](https://www.fastcompany.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry).

UI is suitable for those who want to focus on visuals, layout, the general look, and the product feel. While, UX will suit those who want to use analysis and testing to help users meet their needs.

### 4. Internet of Things
IoT is the interconnection of computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, animals, objects, and people provided with unique identifiers. 
IoT enables the transfer of data over a network without requiring a human on a computer or human-to-human interaction. IoT connects objects to the internet and allow communication to take place. Whether its the curtains, cars, door, refrigerator, and home appliances.  Sensors  installed to objects communicate and send data to the cloud.

According to [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet-of-things-iot-set-1/), IoT will soon turn Nature into Smart Nature. According to statistics recorded in 2017. The number of devices using IoT reached 8.4 billion. In year 2020 the number of IoT devices is expected to reach [30 billion](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article). Learning IoT is vital because there are more IT workers needed.

### 5. Robotics Process Automation
Like AI, Robotics Process Automation, or RPA revolutionize the way organizations work today. Robotic process automation is technology or software that mimics the actions of a human being interacting with digital systems. 
Computer software or robots are configured to work and imitate how people interact with the systems for business processes. RPA is an evolving technology, which involves tasks that are repetitive and can be automated. With RPA, we can reduce human error, save time, and reduce operating costs. RPA technology is growing fast and widely used in manufacturing, analytics, and data entry companies.

Skills needed to become an RPA developer are Python, Java, AI and ML, MySQL, and Scala.

### 6. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
Virtual Reality (VR) is the technology that immerses the user in an environment that makes you believe that you are entirely different. At the same time, AR enhances the ground around the user. Both VR and AR skills are in-demand, to get started with these technologies, programming skills are essential and a forward-thinking mindset.

### 7. Cognitive Cloud Computing
Cognitive Cloud Computing is one of the next big things in the IT industry. This technology uses the idea of Man and Machine together in one. It can converse in natural language and help in decision-making. It has made computers smart enough to function like human brains. Businesses are deploying cloud computing applications and solutions in their processes.

### 8. BlockChain
Blockchain is another leading emerging technology. Blockchain is a list of records called blocks that linked together using cryptography. It facilitates transactions of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchain increases security and speeds up [exchange of information](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/).

Blockchain engineer's jobs are in demand. Skills needed to become a Blockchain developer are Python, Cryptography, Internet Security, Large codebases, C/C++, No SQL databases, and Relational databases.

### 9. Big Data Analytics
Big Data refers to enormous amounts of data used to reveal patterns, trends, insights, and associations if appropriately analyzed. Hadoop and Spark are frameworks for solving Big Data problems and analyzing the data. Having Big Data knowledge and [skills is vital](https://www.edureka.co/big-data-hadoop-training-certification).

### 10. Edge Computing
Edge Computing is a technology designated by many applications applied in industries. This technology processes sensitive and delicate data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing act like [mini datacenters](https://www.simplilearn.com/edge-computing-vs-cloud-computing-article).
