### Introduction.
Python is a programming language that creates a wide range of applications with different functionalities and capabilities. Developers find it a better choice for their Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning projects. AI has provided a technological world of endless opportunities for application developers.

This article will look into the reasons that make Python a programming language used by developers working in machine learning and deep learning and why it should be considered when building an AI project.

### Understanding AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
AI refers to any intelligence shown by a machine that can lead to a feasible solution to the problem at hand. Machine learning expands on AI methods further by using [algorithms](https://www.thinkautomation.com/eli5/what-is-an-algorithm-an-in-a-nutshell-explanation/) to analyze data and learn from the same to make better decisions.

Deep learning works similarly but has different capabilities, like drawing conclusions that resemble human decision-making. It is made possible by using well-structured layers of algorithms inspired by a human brain's neural network.

### Reasons for Python Language for Machine Learning.
**A huge number of libraries and frameworks:** Python language comes with many [libraries](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-libraries/) and [frameworks](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) that make coding easy and saves on development time, making it a popular language choice among developers.

The most popular libraries are [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), which is used for scientific calculations; [SciPy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) for more advanced computations; and [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), for learning data mining and data analysis. 

These libraries work alongside powerful frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn), [CNTK](https://cntk.azurewebsites.net/pythondocs/), and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). The libraries and frameworks are essential when it comes to machine and deep learning projects.

**Simplicity:** Pythonâ€™s code is concise and readable even to the new developers, which is beneficial to machine and deep learning projects. Due to the language's simple syntax, the development is fast compared to many programming languages. Furthermore, it allows the developer to test algorithms without implementing them.

Also, the readable code is vital for collaborative coding or even machine learning or deep learning projects; the change between development teams is easy.

One can easily find a Python developer for the team as Python is a familiar platform; therefore, a new developer can quickly get acquainted with Python's concepts and work on the project instantly.

The developers need not worry about the language's technicalities because Python has a simple syntax; hence they can focus more on solving a machine learning problem that requires complex algorithms.

**The massive online support:** Python has been an open-source programming language and enjoys excellent support from many resources and quality documentation worldwide. Also, it has a large and active community of developers who provides their assistance and advice at any stage of development.

Most scientists have adopted Python for Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects, which means most of the brightest minds worldwide, can be found in Python communities.

**Fast development:** Python has a syntax that is easy to understand and friendly, with many frameworks and libraries the language offers makes development easy, fast, and productive. By using out-of-box solutions, a lot can be done with little code needed. It is better for developing rapid prototypes, thus accelerating the development.

**Flexible integrations:** Python projects can be integrated with other systems coded in different programming languages, meaning it is much easier to blend it with other AI projects written in other languages out there. 

Also, since it is extensible and portable can efficiently perform cross languages tasks. The adaptability of Python makes it easy for data scientists and developers to train machine learning models.

**Fast code tests:** Python provides a lot of code review and test tools. It would mean that the development team can quickly check the correctness and quality of the code. 

AI projects tend to be time-consuming, so a well-structured environment for testing with ease of checking for bugs is needed, and Python is the ideal language that offers that benefit.

**Performance:** Some developers argue that Python is relatively slow compared to other programming languages. As much as speed is not one of Python's strong suits, it provides the solution known as [Cython](https://cython.org/). 

It is a superset of Python language designed to achieve code performance the same as C language. Developers can use Cython to code C extensions the same way they code in Python, as its syntax is almost the same. Cython significantly increases language performance.

### Conclusion.
Many other languages can be used in AI projects, but the fact remains that Python still the best and should be given significant consideration. It can be incorporated into the developer's workflow alongside the tools one is already using.

Today's developers use Python programming language for their machine and deep learning projects as the language brings on board many benefits, as discussed above in the article.
