# Data Studio

## Introduction
[Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) is a free data visualization platform by Google. It allows you to bring different sets of data into one place and transform that data into useful report. You can choose from a variety of graphics, charts, and tables to bring your data to life. This makes it easier to see the story behind the numbers, share your findings with stakeholders, and collaborate with others. Data studio is cloud based so anyone you want can see your reports anytime. When building a report, you can choose a template or create a new one. Editing a report is easy; simply insert and drag charts, then edit the charts using data filters and formatting. You can also add design components such as text, shapes, and images to tell a compelling story and communicate your goals.

Data studio can load data from a variety of sources such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [Google Ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ads) and more. Developers can even create custom data connections for their own platform. Once you've connected data to Data Studio, your reports will dynamically update if the data changes. Which means you don't have to redo manually. Data Studio is easy, free and customizable to your business needs.
