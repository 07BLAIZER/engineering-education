### The revolution of Blockchain in health care

[Blockchain has great potential promises for stakeholders in the health care ecosystem](https://nimbus-t.com/blockchain-opportunities-for-health-care-deloitte-us). Using this technology provides the potential to deliver great value of care. In a long run, using a [blockchain network nationwide](https://www.parathon.com/understanding-blockchain-in-healthcare-and-how-it-is-beneficial-to-providers.html) for electronic medical records (EMR) will support better health outcomes for patients and may improve efficiencies in healthcare delivery.

##### What is Blockchain?
A Blockchain, which was  originally called block chain, [can be defined as a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, that uses cryptography to link and secure the blocks](https://nodemads.net/service/blockchaineducation).It can also be described as "an open, distributed ledger where transactions record can be verified between two parties and stored permanently." Blockchain is a distributed computing system which is secured by design. This makes Blockchain suitable for the performing task such as recording of medical records, and other management activities, like transaction processing, documenting provenance, voting, identity management or food traceability. 

##### Advantages of Blockchain in healthcare 
***For provenance and increased data integrity :*** [Transactions in the Blockchain network are immutable](https://medium.com/pikciochain/how-is-blockchain-revolutionizing-healthcare-7f6d2a48e561). Once the transaction is conducted it cannot be altered or deleted. Transactions are shared across the network and securely recorded. The data integrity safe, and time-stamp can be verified by any user. The original author of a transaction in a blockchain network is indicated once conducted and it remains like that for the entire life of the blockchain.

***It is secured:*** Transactions on the blockchain network must first be verified by other blockchain users Before it is recorded, then after verification, the transaction is encrypted and linked to a previous transaction using cryptography. [It’s virtually impossible to hack the because the data is stored across a network of devices](https://medium.com/pikciochain/how-is-blockchain-revolutionizing-healthcare-7f6d2a48e561).

***It is transparent:*** Before an existing version is changed everyone in the blockchain network must agree because they all share the same documentation. An overhaul of the whole network would be required to change a single transaction on a blockchain network, making the data on the network transparent, consistent and largely accurate. All participants can access any transactions on the blockchain because it is decentralized as long as they have a private key. This makes it easier to sharing of information across multiple platforms.

### Implementing Blockchain in health care

There are numerous applications of Blockchain in health care, they includes;

#### RECORD KEEPING
***Medical treatment history tracking***
With Blockchain patient’s medical treatment can be tracked anywhere and anytime with no ambiguity and hence giving the health practitioners a better understanding of the patient.
_In Data Security: [Do you know that your medical data is worth more than your credit card number in the black market?](https://medium.com/pikciochain/how-is-blockchain-revolutionizing-healthcare-7f6d2a48e561) According to a report by Protenus Breach Barometer, between 2015 and 2016 health records of about 140 million patients were hacked._
>**Blockchain has the potential to keep your private information safe and secure while still being able to connect it everywhere**

***Medical devices usage history tracking***
The use of  medical devices such as electronic wearables have now been on the increase, analysis shows that there’s a 40% percent chance that medical patients uses a medical device to track their health status, but this becomes a problem making it difficulty to store all those daily medical reports from the device for the patients, but with blockchain all this records can be safely stored.

***In supply chain tracking of drugs***
Statistics report shows that drugs sold in developing countries over 15% of them are counterfeit, according to Hudson River Field Office (HRFO), about $200 billion is also lost annually by pharmaceutical companies due to counterfeiting. Blockchain can curb this trend, with its features of point-by-point tracking possibilities and proof of authenticity, ensuring that a drug is genuine and authentic after production allowing users to verify them before purchase or consumption.

#### DIGITAL IDENTITY
***Patient identity validation***
Blockchain can solve the issue of patients’ identity theft and will reduced the use of fake ID’s by impersonators to buy drugs for drug abuse purposes or any bad reason.

***Health care providers identity validation***
Although this might sound usual but impersonation by fake medical personal is more common in third world countries and have caused great number of deaths, but with blockchain these issues can be address with its validation system.

***Drug identity validation***
Drug identity can be validated using the blockchain technology. By providing information about the drug thereby reducing fake drugs into circulation.

#### FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
***Direct health care service payment***
Blockchain technology have indeed proofed the it is a great platform for financial transactions through the use of bitcoin and this model can also be applied into health care.


#### SMART CONTRACT
***Backing research/treatment of health care data***
There have been a lot of challenges when coordinating  research and clinical trials because there are several institutions involved in it, leading to theft of intellectual property and dishonesty. Using blockchain can change this through authentication of documents by the user ensuring the proof of existence. Test results, statistics and quality reports can be shared amongst researchers without any fear of intellectual property theft.


#### Implementation challenges and considerations
Although Blockchain technology is not fully mature today but presents numerous opportunities for health care, however some features of it can be implemented today. But before blockchain can be adopted by organizations in health care nationwide several challenges such as behavioral,technical, organizational and economics must be addressed .
