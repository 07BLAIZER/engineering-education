### An Introduction to CI/CD Tools
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are sets of operating principles and practices that enable software development teams to perform frequent changes in the codebase while ensuring its consistency. The implementation of seamless synchronization in the work process between teams in an organization is often referred to as the pipeline of CI/CD.

CI/CD is one of the best practices for integrating workflow between development teams and IT operations. It serves as an agile approach that focuses on meeting business requirements, quality code, and security, while the implementation and deployment process is automated.

## Technique of CI/CD
Continuous Integration (CI) is a programming practice requiring developers to incorporate code changes into a shared repository. Changes committed to the repository are verified by an automated construction, which ensures that bugs are spotted early before deployment.

Understanding the CI process in-depth, whenever a change is made to the source repository in a version control system, an automated process builds the framework and run a series of tests to ensure the recent code update integrates with the existing code in the repository. If it doesn’t, then a conflict error occurs.

When a conflict error occurs between the newly integrated code and the existing code, it is difficult to track the source of the conflict and fix it. However, with the aid of Continuous Delivery, developers in large organizations can securely and rapidly organize changes of all sorts, e.g. features upgrade, interface changes, bug fixes and tests in production environments or to deploy sustainably to the end-user.

The technique behind the integration of CI/CD in the software development process is that in a large organization with teams of thousands of developers making changes regularly, we can still ensure that the software doesn’t break and changes are being synchronized seamlessly, therefore ensuring effective communication between developers and operations.

## The Importance of CI/CD
- CI reduces the number of processes that are repeated across all project operations, including code compilation, database integration, testing, inspection, deployment and feedback.
- The core importance of Continuous Integration is to ensure that software being developed is deployable to end-users, but with better quality and lower risks of failure. 
- CI gives you the ability to spot trends and make informed decisions, as well as the courage to make new changes. When there is no actual or recent data to support decisions, projects suffer, and everyone makes their best guesses.
- Successful implementation of CI practices can boost confidence in software development, such that, the team will know that tests checks are passed, project code and design follows development standards and the end result is a functioning testable product with each build.

## Jenkins as a CI/CD Tool
Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java. It is a server-based continuous integration application that requires a web server to operate on.

In this article, we'll provide a structural approach to using Jenkins in automating the entire deployment process and using a docker container to deploy our code to the server. The whole development cycle will be based on the DevOps model with the help of DevOps tools as well.

The following steps illustrate the generic approach of implementing Jenkins:
This article assumes that you have prior understanding of implementing CI/CD tools and thereby reinfornces on that knoweledge to adequately provide a step-by-step approach to using one.

To use Jenkins with your software, you can either build a git repository or use an existing one for your CI/CD. The development team is in charge of comitting the code to the Dev-Branch.

When changes are adequately committed to the Dev-Branch, Jenkins can download the source code from Github and have it mapped to a job that is configured for a particular role. Once a job is configured, you must ensure that continuous integration and continuous development are completed for the job/task.

On successful completion of a job, Jenkins will fetch the code from the Github repository, then it starts the task's commit process. Jenkins will proceed to a new phase called the task's construct phase. 

The task construct phase is the phase where Jenkins will compile the code and have it deployed after the DevOps team merges it to the Master branch, then the code is now ready for deployment.

The deployment process is activated once Jenkins has deployed the code. It is then deployed to the server using a Docker container.

## Docker Container 
A docker container is essentially a set of virtual environments where we can create a server and deploy the objects to be examined. The use of Docker will enable the developer to run an entire cluster in a matter of seconds.

With the Docker container setup, the next phase includes the unit testing on the staging server, then the same code is deployed to the production server once all tests are passed.

## CircleCI as a CI/CD Tool
CircleCI is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform that enables rapid software creation and deployment. CircleCI helps users to automate their entire pipeline, from code creation to testing and deployment.

CircleCI is best implemented to construct builds when new code is committed to a version control system such as GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. CircleCI also offers a cloud-managed option for continuous integration or runs on the private infrastructure behind a firewall. 

Amongst developers, CircleCI is rapidly growing as the core choice for CI/CD, due to its lightweight continuous integration and delivery framework that supports almost all programming languages. It also has huge compatibility support with top cloud hosting services such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Heroku.

## Key Features
- It is supported by Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitHub Enterprise.
- Uses a container or virtual machine to run builds.
- Debugging is easy.
- Fast tests
- Notifications via email and instant messaging that are personalized
- Exceptionally adaptable
- Package uploading with automated merging and custom commands
- Setup is easy, and you can create as many times as you want.

## Implementing CircleCI
To leverage the features of CircleCI, the version control system to be used should either be GitHub or Bitbucket. When you add a new project to CircleCI, you would be required to set some permission parameters, and that's to your preference as a developer. 

However, when you add a new project, you have to add the following cloud settings:
- A deploy key is required for testing the project from Bitbucket Cloud or GitHub.
- A service hook is required by GitHub or Bitbucket cloud to alert CircleCI.

By default, CircleCI creates a service hook. As a result, builds are activated for all repository service hook, with PUSH being the most common cause of triggering a build.

## Bamboo as a CI/CD tool
Bamboo is a continuous integration server that creates a continuous delivery pipeline by automating the management of software application releases. It also covers the building of tests, assigning versions, tagging releases, deploying and activating new versions on the production server.

Developers can use Bamboo integration to automate construction and test processes for any software program. It also provides a platform for segregating builds with different targets and specifications. Another benefit is the ability to automatically deploy the program into the server for release, which saves a lot of time when compared to manual testing. 

## Why Bamboo
Bamboo is a continuous integration server that reduces the time it takes to perform builds and deployments. Among its benefits are the following:
- Numerous Bamboo-compatible integrations make it even easier for companies to evaluate and make changes based on test analytical data.
- Quality assurance, release management, and build status are all visible in one place.
- Most of the functionality is pre-built into the platform, so plugins aren't needed.
- Bamboo's CI is also deployment-ready thanks to its seamless integration with Jira and Bitbucket.
- Tinder's user interface is simple and intuitive, making it simple to navigate through options and tools for quick and easy functionality.
- The various staging environments available on Bamboo enable the QA and development teams to deploy environments on-demand without disrupting the production environment.

## Implementing Bamboo
Bamboo's workflow is fairly straightforward in the process of coordinating builds and test suites. The configuration of its workflow order of actions is usually divided into different segments and sections that make up the workflow's building blocks. 

The Bamboo workflow building blocks are: 
- Plans
- Jobs
- Tasks

## The Plan Block 
By default, plans have only one stage. It can, however, be used to divide jobs into different stages and then execute them as needed. For faster execution and app tests, plans use the same repository to run a series of one or more stages sequentially. Plans ensure that you have everything in one place, even though you have separate stages to separate jobs and tasks within them.

## The Jobs Block
Jobs are a collection of tasks that are executed in a specific order on the same agent. They give you control over the order in which the tasks for your build must be completed. Jobs gather task requirements to map out the skills needed in the Bamboo CI Server's comprehension.

## The Task Block
Tasks are the smallest discrete working units that carry out any system's command, such as parsing test results, executing maven goals, running scripts, and executing source code checkouts are examples of general tasks within a job on the working Bamboo directory. These tasks run in order. 

## Buddy as a CI/CD tool
Buddy is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tool that builds, tests, and deploys websites and applications using code from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. It uses Docker containers with pre-installed languages and frameworks, as well as DevOps, tracking, and notification activities, to build on.

## Why Buddy
The following are the reasons why Buddy is a good choice for CI/CD:
- Customization is easy. As a test environment, Docker-based images are used.
- Intelligent change detection, state-of-the-art caching, parallelism, and overall optimizations
- Builds and test environments can be created, customized, and reused.
- Scopes: workspace, project, pipeline, activities, plain and encrypted, fixed and settable
- Elastic, MariaDB, Memcached, Mongo, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Selenium Chrome, and Firefox are examples of attachable services.
- Coupled with real-time progress and logs, as well as an unrestricted history, you can keep track of everything.
- Management of workflows with templates for cloning, exporting and importing pipelines
- Support and integrations for Git that are second to none

Buddy also has a zero-downtime deployment solution (Action) that you can configure with their GUI by specifying the server and the git repository. You can also add an SSH action to run some build commands on the server or use Buddy's filesystem to build the assets (artefacts). Buddy creates the necessary folders on the server and deploys the application using the code from the git repository.
