Firebase ML Kit's text recognition APIs can recognize text in any Latin-based character set. They can also be used to automate data-entry tasks such as processing credit cards, receipts, and business cards. In this tutorial, we will be building a Non-Expo React Native application to recognize text from an image using Firebase's ML kit.

Cloud Vision APIs allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content. [Cloud Vision Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs).
