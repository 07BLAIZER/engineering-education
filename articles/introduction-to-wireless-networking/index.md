## Introduction to Wireless Networking 
Imagine an environment where there is no networking fiber or cables, and you cannot use your laptop to connect to the internet.  
If you're asking yourself the possible solution to this question, then you're in the right place.  

In this tutorial, we are going to discuss the following:-
* Definition of wireless networking
* How wireless network works.
* Types of wireless networks
* Wireless networking standards  
* Benefits of wireless networking

### Requirements
Basic knowledge in networking, you should have known about wired networking, LAN, WAN et cetera, networking devices, e.g., routers, switches, hubs, and et cetera.  

### A Quick Look at Networking?
First, let's remind ourselves of computer networks, remember you can skip this section if you're already familiar with computer networks.  

Computer networks simply refer to the computers connected to enable them to communicate and share resources. 

For example, in Local Area Networks, computers are interconnected in a small area such as an office, to each other via communication cables.  

### What's Wireless Networking?

This refers to the technology where devices can communicate with each other without being tethered to any wires or cables.

As we have already learned, in networks such as LAN, computers are interconnected to each other, which is not the case with Wireless networks.  
In this case, one drawback is that your desktop or laptop has to be physically connected or tethered to a router, let's say via ethernet, minimizing the portability of your computers.  

Now let's look at how wireless networks work and overcome the above-wired networks drawback.  

### How Does A Wireless Network Works?

While learning about computer networks, you might have come across radio frequency technology.  
Well, if you haven't, then let's remind ourselves of what it means and its role in wireless networking, and always feel free to skip this part if you're well conversant with radio frequencies.

#### ```Radio Frequency Wireless Technology```
Radio Frequency (RF) refers to the electromagnetic signals which are always sent wirelessly to allow for communication.  
These signals are unique and, therefore, cannot interfere with each other.
For more information on radio frequencies click [here](https://eu.mouser.com/applications/rf-wireless-technology/#:~:text=A%20radio%20frequency%20(RF)%20signal,from%203kHz%20to%20300%20GHz.)

Now that we've got a little knowledge of Radio Frequencies, a point to note is that wireless networks depend on this technology to accomplish their tasks. 

NOTE:- This technology is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Therefore we won't discuss it in-depth, but you're free to find good books on the topic.  

For wireless networks to work, a device is known as ```Access Point(AP)``` is required.  
The Access Point has its sole responsibility to broadcast(distribute) the signals so that the devices can detect and connect to them.  

Have you ever wondered how public WIFIs, e.g., the ones in hotels, schools, or airports, work?  
Imagine you simply turn on your Wi-Fi on your device, search for available networks, and connect in case they don't require authentication.   

This is interesting, isn't it? But actually, how it works behind the scene is that your Access Point(commonly known as AP) is achieved by connecting the router to the ethernet, in most homes, the Internet Provider via fiber or any other cable.  
This, in turn, provides the Access Point with an internet connection and a bandwidth, the maximum data transfer rate.

Now that our Access Point has an internet connection, what next? It will now be able to transmit and receive wireless signals in its own defined frequency range.    
This will therefore enable you to connect wirelessly to your Local Area Network and the rest of the internet.  
It's that simple.  

### Types of wireless networks

We now have an idea of how wireless network works, let's turn our attention and have an insight on different types of wireless.

#### 1. Wireless Local Area Networks(WLAN)

This type of wireless network is set up to serve a given population. The connectivity is restricted in a particular environment such as hospitals and schools.  


#### 2. Wireless Wide Area Networks(WWAN)
This is a type of wireless internet connectivity that covers a very wide area.  
This is usually achieved by interconnecting to the smaller existing networks. For example, several ```WLANs``` are connected to form ```WWAN```.  
Take, for example, a bank has a head office, and several offices, the WLANs for each bank are then interconnected to form Wide Area Networks. 

A point to note is that Wide Area Networks do not connect to your individual computers but instead to several Local Area networks.  

#### 3. Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks(WMAN)
This is a network within a metropolitan area. Lets's take, for example, a given city like New York.  
It covers a larger area than Local Area Networks but a smaller than Wide Area Networks.  
This type of network is commonly used in schools, universities, and public areas with a high-speed internet connection.  


### Wireless networking standards 

Wireless technology has evolved over a long period, hence the technology associated with it.  
It's always advisable to do your background checks before purchasing any of these technologies.   

The most common wireless technologies in use today include:-  
- ```IEEE 802.11b-1999 (802.11b)```- This technology provides transmission of up to 11Mbps and is backward compatible.  
- ```IEEE 802.11g-2003(IEEE 802.11g)```- This is a popular technology that provides up to 54Mbps and covers a distance of 150 feet.  
- ```IEEE 802.11n-2009(IEEE 802.11n)```-This technology is aimed at improving the throughput of the frequency range between 2.4GHz and 5GHz. It uses several antennae, which in turn increases the data rates.  


### Benefits of wireless networking
- It has greatly contributed to the Voice over Internet(VoIP) as calls can now be made easily over this protocol.  
- It has enabled mobility, a greater advantage to its users as servers can be accessed anywhere as long as Access Point access exists.  
- They are relatively cheap are compared to wired networks, which involve a lot of expenses on buying cables.  
- The network is secure due to the data encryption with current technologies. This allows for the sharing of sensitive information.


### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have been looking at wireless networks, how it works, and its defined standards.  
We have also seen different types of Wireless Networks and how they relate to each.  
You have now laid a strong foundation in your wireless networks.
