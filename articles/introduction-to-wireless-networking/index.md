### Introduction

Wireless networks have exploded the world currently, all the same, we all hate wires all over, or don't we? Or perhaps not!  
It has even replaced desktops that had connectors (RJ-45) on the wall.  
Okay, let's say you go to a big hotel or airport, they will have a wireless network that you can use to access the internet.  
The world has undergone a lot of internet evolution. 
I would tell you this for sure if you wanted to buy a laptop that had the specification of a desktop with an RJ-45 connector on the wall,
you would pay the double price.  
Nowadays, the laptop price is affordable, or isn't it?  

In this article, we are going to discuss the following:

* Definition of wireless networking
* How wireless network works.
* Types of wireless networks
* Wireless networking standards  
* Benefits of wireless networking


### A Quick look at networking

Computer network refers to devices, such as computers, fax or even printers connected or linked to each other to communicate and share resources. It makes use of transmission media such as wires and cables.
For example, in Local Area Networks (LAN), computers are interconnected in a small area such as an office via communication cables.  

The main reason for connecting several devices on a network is to share resources. For example, an office has one printer shared, it can be connected to all computers within this office on a network to allow usage by each department.  

You ought to have also learned that computer networks have five components.  
They include  ***message, sender, receiver, protocol, and Transmission media***.  


### What's wireless networking?

Wireless networking refers to the technology where devices communicate without being tethered to any wires or cables.  
As we have already learned, in wired networks, computers are connected physically via transmission media,  
which is not the case with Wireless networks.  
Now, wired networks have one drawback, that is, your desktop or laptop has to be physically connected or tethered   
to a router or access switch, let's say via ethernet, minimizing the portability of your computers.  

Obviously, in wireless, we don't use cables but radio waves instead.
But do you remember **Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)** used in half-duplex networks?    
Wireless networking is always half-duplex where the transmission can only take place in a single direction.   
The main reason why wireless is half-duplex is because of sending and receiving on a single frequency.    
Discussing this always leads to arguments on collisions, but that's beyond the scope of this article.  

### How does a wireless network works?
While learning about computer networks, you might have come across radio frequency technology.    
Well, if you haven't, then let's remind ourselves of what it means and its role in wireless networking.

***Radio Frequency wireless technology***
Radio Frequency (RF) refers to the electromagnetic signals sent wirelessly to allow for communication.  
These signals are unique and, therefore, cannot interfere with each other.
For more information on radio frequencies, click [here](https://eu.mouser.com/applications/rf-wireless-technology/#:~:text=A%20radio%20frequency%20(RF)%20signal,from%203kHz%20to%20300%20GHz.)

Now that we've got a little knowledge of Radio Frequencies, a point to note 
is that wireless networks depend on this technology to accomplish their tasks. 

>This technology is beyond the scope of this article. Therefore we won't discuss it in-depth, but you're free to find good books on the topic. 
For wireless networks to work, a device is known as `Access Point(AP)` is required.   

The ***Access Point (AP)*** has its sole responsibility to broadcast(distribute) the signals so that the devices can detect and connect to them.  
Have you ever wondered how public ***Wi-Fi***, e.g., the ones in hotels, schools, or airports, work? 

How it works is that wireless networks create a two-way data communication channel.    
A computer has a wireless adapter that it uses to translate the data into a radio signal transmitted via an antenna.  
A wireless router then receives this radio signal. The router decodes this signal and sends information using a physical connection.  
Now that our Access Point has an internet connection, what next?  
It will now be able to transmit and receive wireless signals in its own defined frequency range.   
This will therefore enable you to connect wirelessly to your Local Area Network and the rest of the internet.  

### Types of wireless networks

We now have an idea of how wireless network works, let's turn our attention and have an insight on different types of wireless.  

***1.Fig 1.0 WLAN***

***1. Wireless Local Area Networks(WLAN)***

**WLAN** refers to the type of network connecting two or more computers via a wireless distribution method.  
They have high-frequency radio waves and an AP ( access points) to the internet.  
They are advantageous to use as it allows users to move around the coverage area, not restricted to a single location.  
They are also known as ***Local Area Wireless Network(LAWN)***.


### 2. Wireless Wide Area Networks(WWAN)

***WWAN*** is also known as ***wireless broadband***, makes use of cell towers. These towers transmit radio signals spanning thousands of miles, in contrast to WLAN that spans a few hundred feet.    
It comprises three major technologies, Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and the newer WiMAX.  
These technologies are beyond the scope of this article, but you're free to look for more resources on the topic or [here](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cdma-vs-gsm-whats-the-difference).  
A point to note is that Wide Area Networks do not connect to your individual computers but instead to several Local Area networks.  

### 3. Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks(WMAN)

MWAN has a coverage range size approximately that of a city. It's smaller as compared to WWAN but larger than WLAN.
It belongs to a single entity such as the government, Internet Service Provider, or cooperation.
MWAN restricts access to authorized users or subscriber devices only.
An example of a form of WMAN **WiMAX*.

### Wireless networking standards 

Wireless technology has evolved over a long period, hence the technology associated with it.  
It's always advisable to do your background checks before purchasing any of these technologies.   

The most common wireless technologies in use today include:-  
- ***IEEE 802.11b-1999 (802.11b)***- This technology provides transmission of up to 11Mbps and is backward compatible.  
- ***IEEE 802.11g-2003(IEEE 802.11g)***- This is a popular technology that provides up to 54Mbps and covers a distance of 150 feet.  
- ***IEEE 802.11n-2009(IEEE 802.11n)***-This technology aims at improving the throughput of the frequency range between 2.4GHz and 5GHz. It uses several antennae, which in turn increases the data rates.  


### Benefits of wireless networking
- It has greatly contributed to the Voice over Internet(VoIP) as calls can now be made easily over this protocol.  
- It has enabled mobility, a greater advantage to its users as servers can be accessed anywhere as long as Access Point access exists.  
- They are relatively cheap are compared to wired networks, which involve a lot of expenses on buying cables.  
- The network is secure due to the data encryption with current technologies. This allows for the sharing of sensitive information.


### Conclusion

We have also seen different types of Wireless Networks and how they relate to each.  
You have now laid a strong foundation in your wireless networks.
