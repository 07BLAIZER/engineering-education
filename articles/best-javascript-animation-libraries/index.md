### Introduction
JavaScript is well known for animating web applications. In this article, we will be discussing JavaScript animation libraries more interactively. JavaScript animation libraries are more efficient to use and advanced compared to SVG and CSS to animate. In today's world, JavaScript is an essential language due to the magic it does while animating.  Animations using JavaScript is a complex task to perform. It needs an extensive amount of knowledge and skills.

### Prerequisites
JavaScript Animation Libraries is an exciting and interactive topic. Therefore, I recommend the reader to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### JavaScript Animations
Animations on web applications are catchy and grab the userâ€™s attention. JavaScript can animate what CSS cannot. JavaScript is a preferable tool to use because it handles more complex and advanced effects. 
There are many JavaScript animation libraries. Here is a list of the best JavaScript animation Libraries you can use in your project.

### Anime.js
Anime.js is one of the best and fastest JavaScript animation libraries you would come across. Julian Garner created anime.js, and it has 37k stars and 2.7k forks on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime).  Anime.js is a lightweight library, which animates CSS properties, DOM elements, and SVG on a webpage. It supports web browsers in chrome, Internet Explorer 10+, and Firefox Mozilla, to name a few. You can use anime.js to create both simple and complex animations on the web.
Anime has a built-in staggering system that creates ripples and makes overlapping animations appear simple. This library allows you to create many animations, effects, and properties, synchronize multiple instances, and control all animation features.
To get started with anime.js, the procedure is very simple. All you need is to include anime.js script from [anime.js CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animejs) in your HTML page.
 <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js"></script>
 

 Here is a simple example of anime.js;

```html

### Velocity.js
[Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) is a JavaScript animation library for fast performing animations. It was created by [Julian Shapiro](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity) to solve the problem of JQuery's slowness when animating complex or extensive animations. 
Velocity.js is a high powered animation engine that creates high-quality animations. It improves the website interface and provides an easy experience to the user. Velocity.js helps you animate, fade and slide animations, color animations, SVG animations, transforms, scrolling, and loops. 

 ### Three.js
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a lightweight and user-friendly JavaScript 3D animation library. It makes it easy to come up with 3D content on a web page. Three.js uses WebGL (Web Graphics Library) to draw 3D animations. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics.
A scene is created with a camera and a geometric cube. A WebGL renderer is created for the scene and the camera.
WebGL renders (draw) 3D graphics on the scene inside the geometric cube. Finally, the geometric cube is animated within the scene for the camera.
To get started with Three.js, download its latest version and include the script on your page using a script tag.
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r122/three.min.js "></script>

Here is a Three.js example;

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Three.js Animation</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="graphics-box"></canvas>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r122/three.min.js "></script>
    <script>
    function main() {
    const canvas = document.querySelector('#graphics-box');
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({canvas});

    const fov = 80;
    const aspect = 2;  
    const near = 0.2;
    const far = 4;
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far);
    camera.position.z = 4;

    const scene = new THREE.Scene();

    const boxWidth = 2;
    const boxHeight = 2;
    const boxDepth = 4;
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(boxWidth, boxHeight, boxDepth);

    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x32aa72});  

    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    function render(time) {
    time *= 0.0002;  // convert time to seconds

    cube.rotation.x = time;
    cube.rotation.y = time;

    renderer.render(scene, camera);
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

main();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```
 Here is Three.js style.css file;
```css
