Node.js and micro-services have an intense connection. Node.js was introduced in app development to make the building of apps based on micro-services easier. The principal idea was to break down Node apps into small, distributed nodes that would communicate with each other to make the whole application function.

In this article, the reader will understand the importance of using micro-services and the key benefits of micro-services when building apps. The reader will also understand the reason Node.js coupled with micro-services is such a good technology to implement when building complex apps and the benefits Node.js can offer during development.

### What are micro-services?

These are a software design pattern which splits up huge applications into a set of small and simple applications or services. The small chunks of applications or services can then be maintained with ease, tested, and [loosely coupled](https://nordicapis.com/the-difference-between-tight-coupling-and-loose-coupling/). This is followed by the independent deployment of these applications in an organized manner around their business capabilities.

Earlier before the introduction of micro-services architecture, apps used to be built as [monoliths](http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2014/11/19/what_is_a_monolith.html). They actually grew into a bigger size, causing problems with their maintainability. The logical solution was to split them up into smaller bits, known as micro-services.

In a monolithic architecture, tasks are not clearly divided nor defined. For instance, fixing a login issue in a huge application could require a developer to first understand the whole codebase of an application, instead of just one straightforward process.

#### Benefits of micro-services

The choice of technology when building applications is not important compared to the business rationale. Introducing micro-services into an app development project provides tangible benefits, as highlighted below.

1. Better structure: a well-structured app is usually easier to understand, meaning that any new features to be added to the app will be easier to design and implement. And therefore, less time and cost is spent on business analysis. Thus developers spend more time on development.
2. Seamless implementation of complex products: complex applications are difficult to conceptualize, build, and maintain. But with micro-services, they are broken down into small bits that are more manageable.
3. Scalability: scaling a monolithic app with a huge [blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) of tightly coupled code is difficult, since a lot of time is spent trying to figure out what&#39;s going on inside. With micro-services, it becomes more apparent, which are the bottlenecks, and therefore getting them to handle more load is easier.
4. Fewer errors: in a monolithic architecture looking for bugs is challenging and time consuming compared to micro-services where the small bit-sized pieces of technology are kept error-free and thus more manageable.
5. Better performance: every micro-service only does one job at a time, meaning that they are easy to tune and optimize for work efficiency.
6. Resistance to vendor lock-in: Offers flexibility as different programming languages can be used depending on the problem.

### Understanding Node.js technology and its benefits

Node.js is an event-driven [JavaScript runtime](http://dolszewski.com/javascript/javascript-runtime-environment/) designed to build applications that can be scaled afterward and runs on the web. Micro-service-based apps build in Node.js can deliver a lot of benefits, as highlighted below.

1. Performance and reliability: the app will be stable and can be scaled to infinity depending on cost. One of the great features of Node.js that enables this is its single-threaded asynchronous architecture meaning that it [spawns](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781785289583/3/ch03lvl1sec34/how-to-spawn-a-process) child processes for some asynchronous tasks, however these tasks are invisible to a programmer and run deep under the hood.
2. Data replication: this is easy with Node.js and is also required by micro-services.
3. Cost control: instead of building another instance to deal with additional traffic or functionality as it happens with monolith apps, by using micro-services, which are Node&#39;s main function, only the part of the app is the one that needs to be replicated and thus saving money.
4. Easier maintenance and updates: writing a new feature is easy, contrary to the monolithic app where there is huge junk of code to be dealt with. The same happens for updates. The system can be improved incrementally in place of investing in a huge and costly code rewrite. Node.js supports this approach by enforcing a [modular](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25972/modular-programming) and service-based structure of the application.
5. Simplified development workflows: developers can work on their respective parts of the app independently, unlike in monolith, where developers depend on each other during the app development process. This is one of the strengths of Node.js since a big app is broken down into small chunks, which are easy for developers to work on their parts independently without interfering with each other&#39;s work.

### Conclusion

This article has highlighted and explained the importance and benefits of micro-services and why Node.js is a good technology to consider when implementing this architecture. The benefits micro-services offer cannot be underestimated. They include painless scaling, cost control, and ease of development and updates. When building complex and high traffic applications, Node.js and micro-services are the best architectures to consider since they make application development and maintenance easier compared to monoliths.
