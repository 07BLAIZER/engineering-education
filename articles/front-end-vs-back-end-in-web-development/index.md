Web development is an important field in the tech industry because it contributes to the development of e-commerce sites, social network services, and complex web applications. Building a web application requires two fundamental parts: back end and front end. Understanding the difference between these parts is important especially to young developers because it helps to determine their right career paths.

This article provides a comparison between back end and front end in web development and provides an overview of how they interact with each other. It also provides a brief guide that can help developers to choose the right development path.

### What is front end development?
Front end development is the section of the web that users interact with. This includes everything that users can see, experience, and touch. It represents the graphical user interface with various icons such as the navigation menu, videos and images. 

This type of development is also called the 'client-side' since it enhances direct interaction with users. Front end developers enhance the attractiveness of web pages by building sites that are user-friendly and easy to use. 

### What is Back end development
Back end development is the section of the web that cannot be seen by users. Users cannot interact with this part. This part handles various behind-the-scene activities such as creating libraries, coding and writing APIs. It involves a higher level of collaboration as compared to front end development.

This type of development can also be termed as ‘server-side’ since it provides the functional support of web applications. The presentation layer of a web page cannot function without back end development. The server-side communicates with the client-side to enable the web application to function well. 

### Differences between front end and back end development
The comparison between front end and back end can be done using the following criteria:

#### Application side
Front end development is done on the client-side of a web application while back end development is done on the server-side. The server-side is connected to a database to respond to requests made at the client-side. 

#### Roles
Back end provides the functionality for the presentation layer while the front end provides the visual aspects that enhance user interaction. Back end is the enabler of the front end side. The latter collects input from users while the former processes it.

Front end enhances accessibility and provides a feature for search engine optimization (SEO). Back end development may involve using backup and security features to secure data and web content.   

#### Front end developer vs back end developer
The Front end developer mostly deals with the design of the website while the back end developer deals with programming. Back end developers ensure that the data requested at the client-side is delivered.  

#### Languages
Front end uses web languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The programming languages used in back end include PHP, Java, Python, and Ruby. 

#### User interaction
In front end, users can interact with the web application through various icons and features. However, users cannot interact with the back end part because it does not provide visual aspects. Instead, it acts as the brain of the web application.

#### Frameworks and libraries
Some of the frameworks used for front end development include AngularJS, React.js, jQuery, SASS, and Flutter. Back end frameworks include Laravel, Express, Spring, and Django. 

### Full stack development
Full stack development entails working on the entire stack of the application. This includes the back end development, API, database, server, and front end development. In this type of development, the developer interacts with both the server-side and the client-side. 

A full-stack developer is required to have multiple skills to build an entire web application. These include coding, testing, debugging, and web design. This developer should also know about databases, APIs, security, algorithms, and [version control systems (VCS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/).

### Choosing the right development path
Various factors determine the right development path for developers. The following are some of the important factors that you can consider before making your choice:

#### Skills required
If you have adequate coding skills and proficient with popular programming languages, then back end development is a good path to follow. This path is ideal if you are also conversant with testing, database and servers. If you are excellent in web design and conversant with HTML and CSS, then front end development can be a good path for you. 

#### Responsibilities
Every development path consists of unique responsibilities. Before choosing a development path, make sure you are comfortable with the corresponding responsibilities.

The following are some of the responsibilities of a front end developer:
- implementing the visual elements of the web application
- designing the user interface of the application
- testing the web application
- modifying the interface of the website 
- working together with the back end developer to solve any arising issues

The responsibilities of a back end developer include:
- analyzing codes, data and processes
- reporting data
- monitoring the status of the server
- troubleshooting issues relating to the server
- creating APIs and performing API integration
- Performing backups and security checks

#### Career ambition 
The choice of development path can also be driven by the career ambition of developers. You should choose front end development if you have the ambition of becoming one of the following: front end developer, front end engineer, web designer, UI/UX designer, or SEO expert. 

You should choose back end development if your ambition is to become one of the following: back end developer, back end engineer, DevOps engineer, software engineer, REST API expert, database designer, or WordPress developer.
