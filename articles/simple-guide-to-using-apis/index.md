# A Simple Guide to Using APIs with Node.js and EJS

**Alternative title: Getting to Grips with APIs: Using Node.js and EJS**

Always wanted to use data from an API (Application Programming Interface) but never knew how? This tutorial will guide you through how to work with your first API using Node.js **Link** and EJS **Link** templating to create a dynamic **(use full-stack instead?)** web app. Don't worry if you've never used JSON before or know very little JavaScript, the guide is aimed at you.

**(Excerpt ends)**

So you've created your [first NodeJS web app](**Link to Converting Static Site article**) but now you want to build on those skills by working with an API. Using your existing knowledge of EJS templating and Node.js, you will be able to work with the Goodreads API to be able to search for, list and return details about books.

**Note:** Don't already have a basic NodeJS web app deployed? Check out my [Converting a Static Site to a Dynamic NodeJS Web App tutorial](**Link to Section article**) which will introduce you to full-stack development.
