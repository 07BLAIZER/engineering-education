### Spring Data MongoDB

### Prerequisites

### MongoDB terminology
**Database** It is a container for collections and can be thought as similar to an RDBMS database, which is a container for Tables.
**Collection** It is equivalent to Tables in RDBMS, but unlike a collection it has a dynamic schema. A collection exists within a database.
**Document** It is a single record in a MongoDB collection. It can be thought of as a row in RDBMS.
**Field** A document has zero or more fields. It's like an RDBMS column having a key-value pair.
**Embeded document**
**Primary key**
**Aggregation pipeline**
