AngularJs and Vue.js are both JavaScript-based frameworks popularly used in frontâ€“end web development. They have a variety of features and functions tailored to meet developer&#39;s and user&#39;s needs.

This article discusses AngularJS and Vue.js, their differences, key features, and use cases.

### An Overview of AngularJS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is an open-source Javascript framework that Google introduced in the year [2012](http://blog.angularjs.org/2012/07/). It is a typescript-based framework developed for custom web applications. All commands are made using templates written in [HTML](https://html.com/) language.

This web framework decreases the number of codes written when developing an application. It is highly recommended for single-page applications. It offers the developers adequate resources that they need in developing user-friendly applications.

AngularJS offers a flexible infrastructure that can sustain very large applications managed by Google. It provides features that enable decoupling of any logic from the Document Object Model ([DOM](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation)) manipulation. It also accommodates HTML extensions. Applications developed in AngularJS facilitate cross browsing. More to this, AngularJS is free of charge.

### An Overview of Vue.js

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is popularly known as a progressive framework. It was introduced in the year [2014](https://vuejs.org/2014/03/22/vuejs-010-release/). Vue.js framework is used to build interfaces. Unlike other frameworks, it is designed to be highly interactive and adaptable. Its library is easily integrable with other projects making it very efficient.

When combined with supporting libraries and mobile tooling, Vue.js can build a highly advanced single-page application. Vue.js uses a modular approach in web development. It usually focuses on the view layer.

### AngularJS&#39; key features

AngularJS has a very reliable and user-friendly framework. Below are some of its key features.

#### HTML UI

AngularJS uses the HTML language, which is declarative and easily understandable. Its interface is well structured, allowing designers to organize the app&#39;s implementation to maintain organization. With such an interface, designers and developers work hand in hand. Designers connect the interface to the UI components as the developers aim at creating the user interface.

#### MVC architecture

This is a software concept used in web application development. This software architectural pattern is the most known strategy used for organizing web applications. MVC is made up of three components. These elements are the Model, the View, and the Controller part. Below are the functions of each component.

- _Model_ - At this level, data is stored and maintained. This data type is very simple and is similar to the likes of Boolean and strings.
- _View_ - This is where the information is presented to the user.
- _Controller_ - This is where the interaction between the view and model takes place. It sends feedback to the input data, engages with the data model, perceives the input data, and then releases it for operation.

#### POJO model

[POJO](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/pojo) Stands for Plain Old JavaScript Objects. tHE POJO Model provides organized logics and objects. With POJO, it is easier for developers to get a planned and fast code without having to keep on checking the app&#39;s data flow.

### Vue.js&#39; key Features

Some of the features of Vue.js include:

- _Data binding_ - This feature facilitates the manipulation of the HTML interface. With the help of the v-bind directive, changing style is possible.
- _Transitions_ - Vue.js provides various methods to have transitions applied when either inserted or removed from the DOM.
- _Computed properties_ - In this feature, no added code is needed. It responds to the changes made on the user interface and then works out the calculations. A computed property is used for any logic that requires multiple expressions.
- _Components_ - Components are very important features of Vue.js. They facilitate the extension of HTML elements to provide reusable interface codes.
- _Custom directives_ - These features provide a structure for surveying data changes for unpredictable DOM behavior.

### Differences between AngularJS and Vue.js

In as much as AngularJS and Vue.js are both JavaScript-based frameworks, they have several differences. Some key differences between them are as discussed below.

#### Performance metrics

Vue.js has higher performance metrics than AngularJS due to the DOM concept. In AngularJS, the change detection system enables a reduction in the DOM manipulation. The app and HTML components can be recompiled even before they are downloaded or used by the browser. This framework can, however, influence the application negatively, thus limiting its success.

The DOM concept in Vue.js offers more reliable ways to change the interface. It provides a reduced running and loading time, resulting in high performance compared to AngularJS.

### Integration with backend technologies

AngularJS is good for developing inbuilt functionalities. It offers flexibility and scalable infrastructure. Besides, it provides a back end that aligns with the client operating side and the sever. It can thus be combined with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and JavaScript.

On the other hand, Vue.js aims at developing a complex and efficient user interface. With Vue.js, a backend framework with understandable code is required. A combination of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and Vue.js is best suitable to satisfy such requirements. Both frameworks are very detailed and well structured.

### State management

[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/https://ngrx.io/) offers state management for AngularJS applications. NgRx is a group of libraries. With the state management library, it is possible to speed up the application&#39;s feedback and boost its application.

Vue.js has fewer framework-based libraries as compared to AngularJS. VUEx manages state in large Vue.js applications. The library stays in check with the reactive data, acts as a database, then spreads the data across the app without tampering with its performance.

### Code length

Vue.js is easier to understand as compared to AngularJS due to its simple syntax. AngularJS uses a more complicated syntax.

### Compatibility with templates

AngularJS&#39; developed projects cannot facilitate backward compatibility while Vue.js&#39; can. With AngularJS, templates are used to keep up with the user&#39;s interaction. It manages the presentation of data in an appealing way. When a template language is offered, it maintains the data binding and also the rendering of HTML.

Vue.js uses templates based on HTML. Small components are bound from the rendered DOM. This enables templates to be compiled; hence DOM manipulation is achieved in the most minimal form.

### Use cases of AngularJS and Vue.js

Both angular and Vue.js have highly contributed to web development. The following real-life use cases depict a clear picture of how they are both applied.
