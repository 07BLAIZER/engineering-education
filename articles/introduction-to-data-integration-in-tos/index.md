Data integration developers require open source tools for synchronizing massive data collected from various platforms in the current data-driven world. Talent Open Studio (TOS) is an open-source application that provides user-friendly and cost-effective solutions for data integration. This application is needed in organizations to enhance data accuracy and improved decision making. 

This article provides an overview of data integration in Talend Open Studio. It starts by introducing readers to Talend Open Studio and Talend data integration. The article has provided a step-by-step explanation of how this application can be installed. Various features have been explained to understand the basics of data integration in TOS.  

### Introduction to Talend Open Studio
Talend Open Studio is an open-source application developed by Talend, a software integration vendor that provides big data, data quality, data preparation, and data integration solutions. 

It is one of the three main products offered by Talend. The other two products include Talend Platforms and Talend Enterprise. Talend Platforms provides solutions such as hybrid cloud and data services. Talend Enterprise provides Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) solutions. 

In Talend Open Studio, data can be combined easily, converted, and updated in different locations. TOS supports data integration, big data, ESB, and ETL (extract, transform, load) implementations. 

Talend Open Studio for data integration is an Eclipse-based tool. In this application, components can be dragged from the palette section of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and connected to run ETL jobs. This tool enhances the automatic creation of Java codes for jobs. It is connected to various data sources such as Excel, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and Dropbox. 

### Talend Data Integration
Talend data integration is a process in which data from various sources is combined to provide meaningful information. Data integration in Talend Open Studio enhances the cleaning of data through some transformation. The cleaned data is then sent to a data warehouse. Various aspects of businesses can be improved by analyzing the integrated data.  

The data integration tool in Talend Open Studio facilitates ETL testing and enables users to perform ETL tasks. This tool consists of open and scalable architecture. It provides a fast way of deploying and developing jobs. 

In Talend data integration, organizations collect data from various platforms or applications and generate a unified view. The new form of data is then analyzed to improve decision-making.

Let’s take an example of a large telecommunication company that wants to integrate massive amounts of data about its customers. The company sells sim cards to customers. Big data is employed in integration because the data is enormous. Data collected from one of the customers can be given as follows.

Customer A purchases a sim card using a passport or government identification card.

His name is given as KL M

The Address has been given as Houston, Houston.

The phone number has been given as 2815091234

The information collected by all the customers (including Customer A) can be cleaned to provide meaningful information. In this case, Customer A’s new data form will look as follows.

Given Name: KL

Surname: M

Address: Houston, Texas

Phone Number: +1 281-509-1234

#### The Repository
The repository displays a tree structure of all the technical items used in designing jobs or describing business models. It is situated at the top left side of the GUI. Some of the things that can be accessed through the repository include job designs, documentation, database connections, business models, and reusable routines. It merely is a central store for items that are important for business modeling or job design in a project.

If you want to create your first job in TOS, you should click on ‘Job Design’ in the repository section and then ‘Create Job’. 

![Creating A New Job](/engineering-education/introduction-to-data-integration-in-talend-open-studio/creating-a-new-job.jpg)

This will generate a table that requires you to fill in the job's name, purpose, and description.

#### The Design Window
This part consists of three main features.
**Workspace:** This is a working area used to lay down business models or job designs. This part is situated in the top middle section. 
- **Designer tab:** This is a tab that provides a graphical display of a job. It opens automatically when a job is created.
- **Code tab:** This tab is used to review the code and highlight any language errors. 
  
#### Palette
This part is situated on the top right corner of the GUI. It enables users to draw models that correspond to their workflow requirements. In this section, various technical items can be dragged and dropped into the design workspace. This depends on the business model or job. 

#### Configuration tabs
This part is below the design workspace. Some of the configuration tabs in the Talend Open Studio include the job tab, context tab, component tab, and run tab. 

- **Job tab:** This tab provides important information regarding the current job. This includes creation date, creation time, name, and version.
- **Context tab:** Context variables are set using this tab. A context tab sets different contexts that will be used in the job design.
- **Component tab:** This tab shows or displays the parameters needed in the configuration of components.
