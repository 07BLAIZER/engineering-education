# How to Create a Professional Email: Setting up GSuite

With the popularity of Office 365 and GSuite it can seem that creating a business email is as simple as signing up for an account and paying the annual or monthly fee. 

However because of spam and fraudulent email protection, if you want your emails to appear in your recipient's inbox, then it's lot more than complicated than that because you have to configure SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain Message Authentication Reporting.)

## Choosing Between Office365 and GSuite

GSuite vs Office 365 (annual vs monthly fee), GSuite basic vs business 

The two main email providers that offer custom domains (yourname@yourbusiness.com) are Office365 and GSuite. These are the business email plans of Microsoft and Google. 

While the choice tends to be which ecosystem you use, do you prefer Google's suite of collaborative software or the desktop apps of Microsoft Office?, each has it's own benefits. 

The easiest pricing structure to understand is GSuite which can be paid either monthly or annually. They have three plans: basic, business and enterprise. Basic is £4.60 a month, business is £9.20 a month and enterprise is £20 a month.

The basic plan is great if you just want a custom email address but if you want more cloud storage than business is the plan to go for. Business offers unlimited cloud storage to over five users (though this restriction has not been enforced) as an upgrade to the 30GB in the basic plan. Enterprise has many security features that would suit a business that needs to restrict access to sensitive documents.

Office365 however, has four business plans, basic, standard, premium and apps though only three (basic, standard and premium) include business email. Basic is £3.80 a month, standard is £9.40 a month, premium is £15.10 and apps is £7.90 a month. Basic is sufficient for email but if you more desktop Office applications than you'll have to upgrade to one of the higher plans.

Both of these email platforms charge per user (email address) though shared email addresses (hello@yourdomain.com) are free.

This guide will use GSuite as an example as it is more popular than Office365 just for emails.

Since you using GSuite or Office 365 then it's a simple as choosing Gmail or Office 365 and go through the automated setup on your favourite email client.
