Cloud computing services have grown tremendously in the recent past. Businesses are using these services to manage their storage, networks, and data processing. Many companies have shifted from the use of local servers to cloud computing services because they are secure, reliable, and cost-efficient. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud are two cloud computing giants that provide cloud computing services. AWS is a platform owned by Amazon, while Google Cloud platform is owned by Google. These platforms compete heavily to gain a big market share in cloud computing.

This article provides a comprehensive comparison between these cloud computing platforms. The comparison will involve analyzing their differences using key parameters. It will also highlight their advantages and disadvantages. By the end of the article, readers will have a good overview of these platforms, which will enable them to make an informed choice. 

### What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides APIs and a cloud computing platform to individuals, companies, and governments. The AWS platform offers cloud computing solutions that are flexible, easy-to-use, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. 

It also consists of offerings such as infrastructure as a service (IAAS), software as a service (SAAS), and platform as a service (PAAS). Examples of the services provided by AWS include networking, storage, remote computing, mobile development, email, analytics, and security.

### What is Google Cloud?
Google Cloud is a cloud computing platform that provides cloud services such as data storage, machine learning, and data analytics. It also provides offerings such as serverless computing, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service. 

Other tools offered by this platform include networking, big data, the internet of things (IoT), management tools, security, and Cloud AI.  Google cloud services share the same infrastructure with other end-user products of Google which include: YouTube, Gmail, and Google Search.

### Features of AWS
* They have a low cost of ownership compared to dedicated or private servers.
* The AWS platform has hybrid capabilities that give it a cutting edge over its competitors.
* Billing and management in the AWS platform are centralized.
* In AWS, applications can be deployed in multiple regions around the globe.
* AWS has an introduction feature called Identity and Access Management (IAM). This feature enhances the creation of groups or users. 
* It enhances virtual privacy through the provision of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that does not interfere with other networks. 

### Features of Google Cloud
* It allows the constant inclusion of more languages.
* In Google Cloud platforms, user experience can be improved if a better user interface is used.
* It can enhance broad network access. 
* Scalable services can be provided by Google Cloud platforms.
* It allows cloud resource pooling- This is a service that enables the provider to serve many customers with provisional services. Adjustments can be made to these services to meet the demand of customers.
  
### Differences Between AWS and Google Cloud
AWS and Google Cloud can be distinguished by key parameters such as users, compute services, storage, Big Data analysis, networking, features, downtimes and pricing. 

#### Users
AWS has been able to attract high-profile clients because it is established, and has extensive experience in cloud computing. AWS platform is used by clients such as Unilever, Samsung, Netflix, Xiami, BMW, and Airbnb. 

Google Cloud Platform has also attracted big clients because its services share the same infrastructure with YouTube, Gmail, and Google Search. Some of its clients include PayPal, Bloomberg, HSBC, and 20th Century Fox.  

#### Compute Services
AWS and Google Cloud use different types of containers in cloud computing. AWS uses Kubernetes while Google Cloud uses Docker and Kubernetes. In AWS, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is offered using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Google Cloud platform uses Google Compute Engine to offer this service.

#### Storage
Google Cloud platform has a storage of 1 GB to 64 TB. AWS platform has a storage of 1 GB to 16 TB. The provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) is 4 GB to 16 TB. AWS uses Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) in file storage while Google Cloud uses Cloud Filestore. 

#### Big Data Analysis
These services use different techniques to analyze big data. AWSLamba is used by AWS while Google Cloud employs AI-First for data management.

#### Networking
Unlike Google Cloud, AWS does not have a tiered networking framework. 

#### Main Service
The main service of Google Cloud is the Compute Engine. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the main compute service of AWS.  

#### Best feature
AWS provides a wide variety of cloud-based services. This platform has been in operation for a longer period than Google Cloud, which has enabled it to offer reliable cloud services. Google Cloud has less experience in cloud services but provides cutting edge services in Big Data.

#### Downtimes
In 2015, both platforms experienced downtimes. Google Cloudâ€™s downtime lasted more than 11 hours, while the maximum downtime that was experienced by AWS was two hours and 30 minutes. Both platforms were improved to reduce the chances of experiencing downtimes. The maximum downtime is an important factor when choosing a cloud service provider. 

#### Pricing
In 2017, AWS announced a [per-second billing for services such as EC2 and EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/). This type of billing was extended to other services such as AWS Batch, Amazon EMR, and provisioned IOPS. In the same year, Google announced that it had extended [per-second billing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/extending-per-second-billing-in-google) to Cloud Dataproc, Container Engine, and Compute Engine. This clearly shows there is price competition between these services. 

Google Cloud platform offers its customers discounts (Committed Use Discounts) that do not come with upfront costs. To counter this, AWS provides Reserve Instances as a way of offering discounts to its customers. Google Cloud has made an extra step in enhancing cost-saving by offering sustained user discounts.

### AWS vs Google Cloud: Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages of AWS
* AWS platform provides an organized framework of services, which enhances ease of use. 
* Amazon Web Services provide fast and reliable cloud computing solutions.
* AWS provides privacy for all the stored work without bugs or incidences of theft. 
* It offers a wide variety of services, with the capability of handling many resources and users.
  
#### Advantages of Google Cloud
* It provides quality computing services in Big Data, machine learning, and analytics.
* It offers considerable load balancing and scaling.
* It has good pricing plans. 
* They enhance the live migration of VMs (Virtual Machines).

#### Disadvantages of AWS
* It has a long deployment process. This process can take up to 20 minutes for one website. 
* It may not be ideal for companies that do not have a high technological capability.
* The cost structure is difficult to understand.
  
#### Disadvantages of Google Cloud
* The Google Cloud lacks certain features that exist in the AWS platform.
* Its user interface does not offer adequate customer support. 
* Google Cloud Platform does not provide in-depth documentation of services and other features.
  
### Conclusion
AWS and Google Cloud are good cloud computing platforms that provide companies with tools for storage, networking, security, and mobile development. Choosing the right provider for your company requires one to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each platform. The choice can be determined by the features needed by the company, the objectives of the organization, and the price that it is willing to pay. 

AWS is leading in several categories such as features, number of customers, and experience in cloud services. Google Cloud platform enhances cost-effectiveness and live migration of VMs. Although AWS is enjoying a bigger market share than its competitor, the fast growth of Google Cloud may lead to the closure of this gap in the coming years. The battle between these cloud computing giants will benefit consumers in terms of lower prices and improved services.
