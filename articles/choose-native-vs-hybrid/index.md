### How to choose between native vs hybrid mobile applications

#### Introduction
A mobile application or app is software application designed and developed for use on portable devices such as tablets and smartphones. Mobile application development is the process of gathering requirements, analyzing, designing, coding, and testing software applications for portable devices. Developers are required to provide expertise in coming up with applications by figuring out how to convert user and technical requirements to efficient and user-friendly software. In doing so, they assess the suitability of choosing either hybrid or native applications. It is difficult to settle on any method especially if the developer is a beginner. The article, therefore, focuses on providing the baseline to determine a suitable approach between native and hybrid applications.

### Discussion
Native applications are made for a particular platform and use a specific programming language while hybrid apps are a blend of native and web solutions developed for cross-platform. Both methods have strengths and weaknesses with the developer left to choose an appropriate one based on user needs. The discussion, therefore, seeks to guide on when and why to opt for a method.

#### App Performance
Native applications use programming languages that directly communicate with the device hardware and all static contents are downloaded during installation. Since they have a better user experience, response time is quicker and contents are readily available. Hybrid apps on the other hand need to make use of a blended platform to interact with device hardware and static contents loaded from the server. Thus, hybrid applications respond slowly as they do not interact directly with device hardware and require an internet connection to load contents.

User experience is affected when orientation changes. Native applications respond faster to change while hybrid applications are slow. Therefore, native applications have a better user experience compared to the hybrid. However, a noticeable improvement has been witnessed based on the production of powerful and faster devices, improved OS versions, experienced developers, and uptake of new technologies.

#### Support and Maintenance
Native applications enjoy full support in apps store and play store compared to hybrid apps that rely on a third-party to deploy the app's wrapper. Hybrid apps have support from the wrapper that provides patches to fix applications. Native applications offer high offline support compared to hybrid as static information is not stored on the server.

#### Feature Accessibility
Native applications have full access to device APIs and can use them with minimal limitation. Hybrid apps require blended technology to use phone native features such as GPS, gestures, camera, etc.

##### User Experience
The user interface in a native mobile app provides a better experience compared to hybrid apps. This is because the user interface elements in native apps are directly coded using a language that is understood by the hardware device while hybrid relies on the developer experience on the web technologies to design suitable elements that are appealing on mobile devices. Therefore, native elements are clear, smooth, and with more visible effects compared to hybrid apps. However, with expert developers on web technologies, the user experience may improve to be almost similar to native apps.

#### Cost of Development
Hybrid applications have a lower cost during the development. Cost is determined by the time taken, app complexity, and platforms supported. Applications that consume a substantive amount of time to develop and deploy attract a higher cost compared to the ones that require less time. Some applications call for the use of certain complex features and/or need complicated algorithms/processes which increase development cost. The expertise level required may be higher adding to the cost. Code reuse in coming up with hybrid mobile apps aid in saving on the cost. Hybrid applications enjoy multi-platform support, unlike the native. This implies that a single application is deployed across platforms saving on the number of software produced and time used in development consequently reducing cost. Clients may need to have several development teams when required for multiple platforms since developers specialize in a single native application area (iOS or Android).

#### App Complexity
Native applications can handle complex functions as they have full interaction with the operating system. Hybrid apps are unable to handle sophisticated functions efficiently therefore, suitable for content-oriented software.

#### Platform Code Support
Native applications enable the production of software compatible with all device levels including outdated ones. It allows control of features like GPS, camera, sensors, etc. Hybrid applications support a minimum SDK level and limit the usage of features based on the availability of third-party libraries. Although native applications appear to win on this, hybrid apps enjoy the single code for cross-platform.

#### Delivery Time
Developing a hybrid application takes less time compared to the native one. Hybrid applications benefit from code reuse, a single code base, and a single application for cross-platform. Code reuse and a single code base significantly reduce development time as programming resources are readily available and in a single place. The ability to generate cross-platform applications from a single software greatly reduces the time for development. Therefore, for businesses with urgent need of a mobile application, a hybrid application would be a suitable choice.

#### Pushing Updates
Hybrid applications store the files on the server which enables updates to be pushed with minimal requirement for user intervention. On the other hand, any change on the native app necessitates a need for an update by the user. This means that if your app will have multiple chances for updates, you may consider a hybrid approach.

#### Scalability
Native applications withstand more features especially those that require interaction with the operating system and hardware are added while hybrid becomes heavy and slower. Hybrid applications can scale up for various operating systems as they utilize web technology as opposed to native.

#### Security
Hybrid applications are at a higher security risk level compared to the native. This is because besides dealing with the programming language security, they deal with issues affecting web browsers and technologies. However, their app security levels can improve by adopting mechanisms such as the use of VPN, micro-services, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

#### Technologies
Native applications are software programs tailored for a specific platform and written using a programming language for the device. They are developed using languages such as Objective-C or Swift for iOS, Java for Android, and C# for Windows. Hybrid apps are made for multiple platforms and use languages such as ionic and Adobe Phone gap with web technologies. Apart from native and hybrid techniques, there exist other languages that provide mobile apps for all platforms and exhibit both native and hybrid features such as:

1. **React native**
It combines native with React to produce a JavaScript library that allows the creation of truly native applications that do not compromise users' experience and have cross-platform support.

2. **Xamarin**
It is a platform for native cross-platform mobile application development that extends the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries. It is used to develop applications for operating systems such as iOS, tvOS, macOS, and Windows.

 #### Conclusion
To decide which approach to follow, one should consider a couple of factors such as time, complexity, and resources. Applications that require intense features, are sophisticated, and have sufficient delivery time should use a native approach. There exist other languages that allow the development of cross-platform mobile applications with native behavior. This article has pointed out what developers, especially beginners, needed to make informed decisions. Start developing your mobile application today, happy coding!
