 ### How to choose between native vs. hybrid mobile applications                                                             
A mobile application (app) is a computer program or software application created for portable devices such as tablets and smartphones. Mobile application development includes gathering requirements, analyzing, designing, coding, and testing software applications for portable devices. 
Developers are needed to provide expertise in coming up with applications. They figure out how to convert user and technical requirements to user-friendly software. In doing so, they assess the suitability of choosing either a hybrid or a native application development approach. 
Both methods have strengths and weaknesses, with the developer left to select an appropriate one based on user needs. It is challenging to settle on a technique, especially for beginner developers. 
This article guides on when and why to opt for each method. Particularly, it discusses hybrid and native apps’ performance, support & maintenance, feature accessibility, user experience, cost of development, app complexity, platform code support, delivery time, pushing updates, scalability, security, and other technologies. This is to provide a baseline for determining a suitable approach between native and hybrid for mobile application development.

### Native applications
Native applications are developed for a particular platform, i.e., iOS, Android, or Windows operating systems (OS). They use a specific programming language of the hardware platform they are made to run in. A single codebase is used to develop apps for different platforms.

### Hybrid applications
Hybrid apps are a blend of native and web solutions. They support cross-platform and function like pure native apps. They have only a single codebase that targets close to all devices.

### Comparing native and hybrid apps                                                                                                           
#### App performance
Native applications use programming languages that communicate directly with the device hardware. Static contents are downloaded during installation. Since the apps have a better user experience, response time is quicker, and contents are readily available. Hybrid apps use a blended platform to interact with device hardware. Static contents for these apps are loaded from the server. Thus, hybrid applications have a slow response as they do not interact directly with the device hardware. They also need an internet connection to load contents.

User experience is affected when orientation changes. Native applications respond faster to change, while hybrid applications are slow. Thus, native applications have a better user experience compared to hybrid apps. However, a noticeable improvement in hybrid apps' performance has been realized. The progress is due to the introduction of robust and faster devices, improved OS versions, experienced developers, and adoption of new technologies.


#### Support and Maintenance
Native applications enjoy full support in the apps store and play store. Hybrid apps rely on a third-party to deploy the app's wrapper. A wrapper is a WebView made from binary files. It allows the app to communicate with the device platform and incorporate operating system features. Hybrid apps get support from the wrapper that provides patches to fix applications. Native applications offer high offline support compared to hybrid apps, as static information is not stored on the server.

#### Feature Accessibility
Native applications entirely access device application programming interfaces (APIs) with minimal limitation. Hybrid apps require blended technology to use features like GPS, gestures, and cameras.

##### User Experience
The user interface in a native mobile app provides a better experience compared to that of hybrid apps. The experience is due to user interface elements in native apps directly coded in a language understood by the hardware device. 
On the contrary, hybrid apps rely on the developer's web technologies experience to design suitable elements that are appealing on mobile devices. Thus, native features are clear, smooth, and with more visible effects compared to hybrid apps. However, with a web technology expert’s input, the user experience in hybrid apps may improve to almost like that of native apps.

#### Cost of Development
Hybrid applications attract lower development costs. Cost is determined by the time taken to develop an application, app complexity, and platforms supported. A higher charge is required to build an application that consumes a lot of time. Applications that require the use of complex features or algorithms increase development costs. The level of expertise required may be higher, adding to the cost of development. 
Hybrid apps utilize code reuse saving on the cost, and enjoy multi-platform support, unlike native apps. A single application is deployed across platforms, reducing the number of software produced and time used in the development, consequently reducing cost. Clients may need to have several development teams to create apps for different platforms because developers specialize in a single native application area (iOS or Android).

#### App Complexity
Native applications can handle complex functions as they can interact fully with the operating system. Hybrid apps are unable to handle sophisticated functions efficiently. They are, thus, suitable for content-oriented software.

#### Platform Code Support
Native applications enable the production of software compatible with all device levels and control features such as GPS, camera, and sensors. Hybrid applications support a minimum SDK level, an integer designating a minimum API level for an app. Hybrid apps also limit the usage of features based on the availability of third-party libraries. Although native applications appear to win on this, hybrid apps enjoy the single code for cross-platform.

#### Delivery Time
Developing a hybrid application takes less time compared to the native one. Hybrid applications benefit from code reuse, a single codebase, and a single application for cross-platform. 
Code reuse and a single codebase significantly reduce development time because programming resources are readily available and located in a single place. The ability to generate cross-platform applications substantially reduces delivery time. Thus, for businesses with an urgent need for a mobile application, a hybrid application would be suitable.

#### Pushing Updates
Hybrid applications store files on the server and enable updates to be pushed with minimal user intervention requirements. On the other hand, any change on the native app necessitates a need for an update. If your app has a significant number of updates, you may consider a hybrid approach. 

#### Scalability
Native applications use complex features efficiently. These features include those that need interaction with the operating system and hardware. Hybrid apps become heavy and slower with the addition of complex components. They scale up for various operating systems as they use web technology as opposed to native apps.

#### Security
Hybrid applications are at a higher security risk level than the native because they deal with issues affecting web browsers and other technologies besides programming language security. However, their app security levels can improve by adopting mechanisms such as the use of VPN, micro-services, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).


#### Technologies
Native applications are software programs tailored for a specific platform and written using a programming language for the device. They are developed using languages such as [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) or [Swift](https://www.swift.com) for iOS, [Java](https://www.java.com) for [Android](https://www.android.com), and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for Windows. 
Hybrid apps are made for multiple platforms and use languages such as [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [Adobe PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com) with web technologies. Apart from native and hybrid techniques, there exist other languages that provide mobile apps for all platforms and exhibit both native and hybrid features such as:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1.	*[React native](https://reactnative.dev)* 
It combines native with React to produce a JavaScript library that allows the creation of genuinely native applications that do not compromise users' experience and have cross-platform support.

2. *[Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin)*
It is a platform for native cross-platform mobile application development that extends the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) developer platform with tools and libraries. It is used to develop applications for operating systems such as iOS, tvOS, macOS, and Windows.

### Conclusion
To decide which approach to follow, one should consider a couple of factors such as time, complexity, and resources. Applications that require intense features, are sophisticated, and have sufficient delivery time should use a native approach. There exist other languages that allow the development of cross-platform mobile applications.
