In the present software development context, the important workflows for software development are run, tested, built, and deployed without setting up CI/CD. All the processes in the software development are done manually from running tests to running build to get the build file and deploying on the server. The development cycle for adding new features and fixing bugs done manually becomes inefficient and hectic due to processes being run repeatedly.
<!--more-->

Will it be better? if we reduce this repetitive manual process using  CI/CD and dedicate most of the valuable time in developing new, innovative, and problem-solving features?

## The solutions can be...

* Creating React application and push the repo to Github.
* Setting up AWS S3 for deployment.
* Setting AWS Cloudfront with HTTPS and CDN.
* Setting up Circle CI to subscribing repository and trigger it when commit received while starting the test, build, and deploy to  AWS.

### How it works…

* When pushing code to the repository ( eg.github, bitbucket ), the repository will trigger (webhook) to CI that subscribes to this repository.
* CI server starts the run command that we prepared( eg run test, check syntax, build, deploy).
* In case an error occurs, notification will be sent.
* A developer will fix the bug and commit code again and loop back to first until the error is resolved.

The steps to setup CI/CD to React ecosystem is explained below:

## Step 1: Setting up Repository

First, we are going to set up a repository in GitHub. The steps are simple. In the GitHub console interface, we just need to click on the ‘**Create new repository**’ button and the following screen will appear:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*G9fZL3zdaij2IqeoI73SDg.png)

Here, we need to enter the project repository name and mark it as public or private. 

Note that, making the repository private is not free.

Now, we need to create a React project and add git configuration to it running the following commands: 

```bash
    $ npx create-react-app my-react
    $ cd my-react
    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'initial commit'
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/krissnawat/my-react.git
    $ git push -u origin master
```

## Step 2:  Setting up AWS S3

Now, we are going to setup AWS S3. First, we need to login to the AWS console. After successful login, we need to go to the S3 menu and create a new bucket as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2480/1*-P_mN8mpAWrDPbcN7qSsZg.png)

Then, a window will open up where we need to enter the bucket name and choose the server region as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2148/1*qfRkbiRRhPJhcGvW1HAtRg.png)

Initially, the bucket will be set to private. So, we need to make the bucket mode public by clicking on the ‘**Bucket name**’ option as directed in the code snippet below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TLrpCTt7lqUdZUlUuzsU6Q.png)

Then, we need to select the ‘**permissions**’ tab as displayed in the code snippet below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CS1IypQDPcP0VXxUYxzcug.png)

In the **permissions** tab, we need to turn-off ‘**Block public access**’ option as directed in the code snippet below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2264/1*aGiUVyYl3RjWhuLTFSxYXA.png)

Now, we move on to the local deployment setup.

### Step 3:  Local Deployment

In this step, we are going to upload our react project directly from the local repository to s3 for testing purposes. Firstly, we need to go to ‘**My Security Credential**’ as directed in the menu screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jv496-SfKim9CIrt1TAzVQ.png)

Then, we need to create a new Access Key and download the key file by pressing the ‘**Download Key File**’ button as shown in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*OGoQp9DkkPxVRpt5WgAcMA.png)

Next, we need to move back to our local repo of our project and install AWS Cli with homebrew running the following command in our project directory:

```bash
    $ brew install awscli
```
Then, we need to run aws configure command and set AWS Access Key IDand AWS Secret Access Key as directed in the code snippet below:

```bash
    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxxxxxxx 
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]:  xxxxxxxxxxx
    Default region name [None]: ap-southeast-1
    Default output format [None]: json
```

Now, we need to go back to the s3 project. Then, we need to navigate to *Properties tab -> Static Web Hosting* as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2044/1*V74Eu1ntBoc8tWg-VHdKVA.png)

In the **Static website hosting** option, we need to enable the hosting as shown in the screenshot below: 

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CFghHg1CR3H3Rzps88jUJQ.png)



Now, we are going to try and build our react project in order to sync with the AWS s3 bucket. For that, we need to run the commands given in the following snippet in our react project terminal:
```bash
    $ yarn build
    $ aws s3 sync build/ s3://myawesomeapp.com --delete(aws s3 sync <% path build folder %> s3://<% bucket-name %>/)
```
Here, ( — delete) means we delete the default project file in the bucket then sync the new project.

If the build operation runs successfully, we will get the following result in our browser window:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2320/1*DZETrwwzyqAfwcaiypRIdg.png)

Hence, we are done with the local deployment of our project. This also completes our setup of AWS S3 in sync with our React Native project.

Now, we move on to set up CircleCI in our react project.

## Step 4:  CircleCI Setup

First, we need to create an account on CircleCI. We can do that using Github login, which simplifies the register and login process. Then, we will be redirected to [https://circleci.com/dashboard](https://circleci.com/dashboard). If not, we need to go to the same URL which is the CircleCI dashboard. In the dashboard, we need to click on the ‘**Add Project’**. In the Projects screen, we need to choose the repository that we want to follow by clicking on ‘**Set Up Project’ **as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3eaufRLEyVfw6dH2w3K9nQ.png)

Now, we can set up the configuration process either on CircleCI or on local projects as well as directed in the screenshots below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d7Ffuw-lknsNS6w5eHFViQ.png)

For local setup, we need to copy and paste the above code to our config file as shown in the code snippet below: 
```yml
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
      aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@1.0.11
    jobs:
      build:
        docker:
          - image: circleci/node:12.9.1-browsers
    
        working_directory: ~/repo
    
        steps:
          - checkout
    
          - restore_cache:
              keys:
                - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
                # fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found
                - v1-dependencies-
          - run: yarn install
    
          - save_cache:
              paths:
                - node_modules
                - ~/.npm
                - ~/.cache
              key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
    
          - run: yarn lint
    
          - run: yarn size
    
          - run: yarn test
    
          - run: yarn build
    
          - aws-s3/sync:
              from: build
              to: "s3://kriss-react-cicd/"
              arguments: |
                --acl public-read \
                --cache-control "max-age=86400"
              overwrite: true
```
For CircleCI, we need to go to the CircleCI dashboard and create a new branch and initialize a ‘pull request’ for that new branch to the master branch. Then, we can work on that branch until deployment is successful as shown in the code snippet below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2504/1*JgmMpN2u8hVAlFg9Kg6R9A.png)

### Step 5:  Setting up Environment Variables

Next, we are going to set up AWS credentials in CircleCI. Firstly, we need to click on the project as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZLCmnLjIHdDT4A5BrMZdiQ.png)

Then inside the project dashboard, we need to click on ‘**Project Settings**’ as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2104/1*MDRaDVGI2cn1OqjzU7Jqvg.png)

Inside the ‘**Project Settings**’ option, we need to click on the ‘**Add Environment Variable**’ button as shown in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2490/1*MDlaYy1nTFBTlKpr7hRZDg.png)

Then, we need to add the correct variables or correct the existing variables as shown in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YpCERVacknCCDiThPMFBqw.png)

Hence, we have successfully configured the Environment variables.

## Step 6:  Setting up AWS CloudFront

We know that we have already successfully deployed our React Native project to AWS from what we did before( [http://kriss-react-cicd.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/](http://kriss-react-cicd.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/)). However, it doesn't set up HTTPs that makes the deployment insecure. Now in order to make the hosting secure, we can use AWS CloudFront. In CloudFront, we need to go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home) and select **Create Distribution -> Get Started**. Then, we need to hit the **Create Distribution **button as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2480/1*GjiMi9TMb_an0iXoyi485g.png)

Next, we need to copy and paste the link from AWS S3 to the **Origin Domain Name** field as directed in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zf0hyf9AWxaDhrLgNNx4Zg.png)

In the Distribution options, we need to supply the following configurations:

* Origin Domain Name: [http://kriss-react-cicd.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/](http://kriss-react-cicd.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/) (s3 endpoint )

* Origin ID: [kriss-react-cicd](http://kriss-react-cicd.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/)

* Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

In case of a successful configuration, we will see the status: **In Progress**. Then, after waiting for around 15 to 20 minutes, the status will change to **Deployed** as shown in the screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lvKkHDgQJraJPJq3as7RoQ.png)

After the status changes to **Deployed**, we will be able to access the site from the domain name [https://dhhqbyhy7gv01.cloudfront.net/](https://dhhqbyhy7gv01.cloudfront.net/). Here, our transmission protocol is already set to HTTPS. The access site from the above domain name is shown in the demo screenshot below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2234/1*ZdqRU6UcHYhWA_1-LuPGRw.png)

Hence, we have successfully set up the CircleCI and AWS CloudFront to our React Native project.

## What’s next …

* Using Circle CI with different platforms such as iOS, Android, etc.

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will be an interesting platform if you host your repository on Gitlab (CircleCI are supported only Github and Bitbucket)

## Conclusion
Well, this tutorial has been long and interesting. Regardless of how long and hefty the setup tasks are, it will be highly beneficial in the long run. CircleCI can do more than what we learned in the article. We should make sure to explore that as well. It will be highly advantageous to setup CI/CD together while starting a new project. Running the test, build, and deployment manually can be hefty work and come at an unacceptable cost. CI/CD makes things automatic which will prove highly efficient in the long run. The CI/CD process also helps to locate bugs in the project easily. If CI is not applicable to your project, an alternative to it can be Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.

Note that if you find any errors while setting up following this article, do not hesitate to notify me. :)
