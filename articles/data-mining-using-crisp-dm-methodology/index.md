### Introduction
With the rise in usage of Data Mining across several industries, the need for a standard framework is required to achieve the project's objectives.

The use of a standard framework helps us in:

- Recording experience, which can be later used in replicating it for other similar projects.
- Improving project planning and management.
- Encouraging best practices used for achieving better results.

With the increase in the projects' complexity, it is recommended to follow a standard framework for achieving goals faster.

### What is CRISP-DM?
> According to [this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/crisp-dm-data-science-project/) article, CRISP-DM stands for CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining and was [developed](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf) in 1996 under the ESPRIT initiative. It has been a favorite for business analysts and data scientists alike owing to its easily adaptable model.

CRISP-DM remains the top methodology for data mining projects. A significant increase in the usage of this methodology can be seen after conducting a poll in 2007 and 2014, as shown in the below image:

> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining#:~:text=Cross-industry%20standard%20process%20for%20data%20mining%2C%20known%20as%20CRISP,most%20widely-used%20analytics%20model.), "A data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches that data mining experts use to tackle problems... it was the leading methodology used by industry data miners."

CRISP-DM is a 6 step process:

- Business issue understanding
- Data understanding
- Data preparation
- Analysis/Modeling
- Validation
- Presentation/Visualization

### Problem Statement
To understand CRISP-DM methodology, let's look at a simple case study.

> A Utility company wants to predict the next days' demand for electricity, to allocate necessary resources for power generation.

Now that we have understood what's the business issue. Let's devise a solution for the prediction of the next days' electricity consumption.

### Steps in CRISP-DM
#### Business Issue Understanding
This step focuses on understanding the objectives of the project and requirements from the business perspective.

Questions to ask are:

- What DECISION needs to be made?
- What INFORMATION is needed to inform that DECISION?
- What type of ANALYSIS will provide the INFORMATION to inform that DECISION?

Now, let's understand this from the perspective of our problem statement.

##### Determining business objectives
This step helps us define the necessary methods to be taken to consider a business as a success.

For our problem, our objective is "Predict approximate electricity consumption for the next day, to allocate necessary resources".

##### Assess the situation
This step helps us analyze the project's current situation by identifying the resources and the stakeholders of the project.

For our problem,

- We must find out the factors which affect the increase in electricity consumption. One major factor affecting it is temperature.

##### Determine data mining goals
This step helps us identify how to translate the business goals into data mining goals and select a proper way for its assessment.

For our problem,

- We must use data mining techniques to find what other factors affect consumption.
- We must find out what type of problem it is - Classification, Prediction, or Clustering?

##### Produce a project plan
This final step helps us create an initial process plan and estimate the effort and resources needed to achieve our goals.

For our problem,

- We must estimate the resources needed for generating electricity.
- We must devise a series of steps for analyzing consumption.
- We must decide how the project is to be evaluated.
- We must decide on the selection of tools and techniques.

#### Data Understanding
> According to Wikipedia, the data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities to get familiar with the data, identify data quality problems, discover first insights into the data, or detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information.

Questions to ask are:

- What data is in need?
- What data is available?
- What are the important characteristics of the data?

For our problem,

- Based on an assumption, we can say that **Date**, **Time**, and **Temperature** are 3 major factors affecting electricity consumption.
- Before proceeding with this assumption, we must perform [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) to verify our assumptions.
- We must research the type of data that will be used for prediction. The type of data refers to discrete, continuous, time-series, or seasonal data.
- We must perform statistical analysis and find the relationship between various types of data.

#### Data Preparation
> According to Wikipedia, the data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset (data that will be fed into the modeling tool(s)) from the initial raw data. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times and not in any prescribed order. Tasks include table, record, and attribute selection and transformation, and cleaning of data for modeling tools.

In this step, we must follow 5 common steps as mentioned in [this](https://quyenntk143.medium.com/problem-solving-framework-crisp-1decbb25a42c) article:

- Gathering: When gathering data - you may need to collect data from multiple sources within your organization.
- Cleansing: The data set you are working with may have issues you want to resolve before your analysis. This can be in the form of incorrect or missing data.
- Formatting: You may need to format the data by changing how a date field appears, renaming a field, or even rotating the data, similar to using a pivot table.
- Blending: You may want to blend your data with other datasets to enrich it with additional variables, similar to using the `vlookup` function in Excel.
- Sampling: Lastly, you may want to sample the dataset and work with a more manageable number of records.

These steps remain common for any type of dataset that we choose, irrespective of the problem.

#### Analysis and Modeling
> According to Wikipedia, various modeling techniques are selected and applied in this phase, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Some techniques have specific requirements in the form of data. Therefore, stepping back to the data preparation phase is often needed.

Things to consider:

- Determine what methodology to use to solve the problem.
- Determine the important factors or variables that will help solve the problem.
- Build a model to solve the problem.
- Run the model and move to the validation phase.

In our problem, we find that there is a high correlation between temperature and electricity consumption. This can found by following a series of steps as mentioned in [this](https://quyenntk143.medium.com/problem-solving-framework-crisp-1decbb25a42c) article:

1. Build a predictive model - predicting the next days' temperature based on history.
2. Validate the model - validate this by predicting the electricity of the next day to check if a correlation exists.
3. Repeat the process - repeat the above 2 processes until gaining correlation confidence.
4. Perform analysis - on gaining confidence, we can analyze that helps us in resource allocation.

#### Validation
> According to Wikipedia, at this stage in the project, you have built a model (or models) that appears to have high quality from a data analysis perspective. Before proceeding to the model's final deployment, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model and review the steps executed to construct the model to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives. A key objective is to determine if there is some important business issue that has not been sufficiently considered. At the end of this phase, a decision on using the data mining results should be reached.

Things to consider:

- Observe the key results of the model.
- Ensure the results make sense within the context of the business problem.
- Determine whether to proceed to the next step or return to a previous phase.
- Repeat as many times as necessary.

In our problem, we have been working based on our assumption that temperature is one of the key factors affecting consumption. While validating, if we find that temperature does not correlate with electricity consumption, we must roll back to the previous step and further revise our model.

#### Presentation
> According to Wikipedia, the creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a useful way to the customer. Depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data scoring (e.g., segment allocation) or data mining process. It will be the customer, not the data analyst, who will carry out the deployment steps in many cases. Even if the analyst deploys the model, the customer needs to understand the actions that will need to be carried out to make use of the created models.

Things to consider:

- Determine the best method of presenting insights based on the analysis.
- Determine the best method of presenting insights based on the audience.
- Make sure the amount of information shared is not overwhelming.
- Use the results to tell a story to the audience.
- For more complex analyses, you may want to walk the audience through the analytical problem-solving process.
- Always reference the data sources used.
- Make sure your analysis supports the decisions that need to be made.

This is one of the most important steps while building a data science project. Though the analysts might have analyzed the problem, visualizing, and presenting the clients/business managers' insights is the key step.

Visualization can be done by plotting graphs, performing statistical analysis, or predicting the next possible outcome. To learn more about visualization, please refer to [this](/engineering-education/matplotlib-visualization-python/) article on Matplotlib visualizations and [this](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-data-visualization-using-pandas/) article on Pandas visualization.
