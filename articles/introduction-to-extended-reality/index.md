# Introduction to Extended Reality (XR)

### What is Extended Reality (XR)?
Extended reality (XR) is a term that encompasses real and virtual environments that are generated by wearable devices or computer technology to provide an immersive experience. It can also be described as a collection of all immersive technologies that combine real and virtual worlds. XR is growing in terms of advancement and application. This technology is still evolving because of ongoing development in human-machine interactions. 

### Pillars of Extended Reality
Extended reality encompasses three main pillars of immersive technology: Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). 
#### Virtual Reality (VR)
This immersive technology employs a head mounted display (HMD) to provide an immersive expression through simulation. The simulated digital environment makes users feel as if they are there. For example, VR developers may create an artificial world that makes users feel as if they are walking around on the moon. The first industries to adopt this kind of technology include the gaming and entertainment industries.

#### Augmented Reality (AR)
In this component of XR, smart devices are used to overlay sounds and digital graphics into the real world. Some of the digital details overlaid into the real-world environment include images, animation and texts. This enhanced experience can be achieved using AR screens, tablets, smartphones or screens. Snapchat filters and Pokeman Go are good examples of AR technology. In the game of Pokemon Go, digital creatures are overlaid into the real world. Snapchat filters involve putting digital objects such as glasses and hats onto the userâ€™s head to provide unique experiences.

#### Mixed Reality (MR)
Mixed Reality encompasses the co-existence of real-world and digital objects. There is an interaction of these objects in real time. This is an advanced immersive technology that needs an MR headset and higher processing power than virtual reality and augmented reality. A good example of mixed reality is Microsoft's HoloLens, which allows users to interact with digital objects that are placed in a room.

### How Extended Reality Works
From a developer perspective, the extended reality is achieved by designing immersive algorithms. Software developers and data scientists should design clever and efficient algorithms to produce interesting XR features that offer unique user experiences. Other important concepts that need to be incorporated by developers of immersive technologies include 3D modelling and advanced computer vision. Artificially intelligent programs are made using machine learning, biomechanical modelling and motion tracking. 

Some of the programming languages used in the design of extended reality include C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Swift. Full description of these languages and their application to AR can be found [here](https://howtocreateapps.com/programming-languages-ar/). Developers that may be interested in applying these programming languages in the development of VR can get more information [here](https://engineering.eckovation.com/programming-languages-develop-virtual-reality-apps/#:~:text=But%20here%20are%20four%20programming%20language%20you%20can,it%20has%20a%20huge%20...%20More%20items...%20).

From a user perspective, the three main components of XR perform specific roles to provide an immersive experience. In AR solutions, smartphone cameras are used to capture a section of the environment. These solutions then scan the captured environment to identify a specific point where additional information will be overlaid. Computer-generated content or digital information is then overlaid in the captured environment using markers. Trackers such as laser, GPS, infrared and sensors can also be used to overlay information in the aforementioned environment. MR works in a similar way to AR, although the former provides a more advanced immersive experience than the latter by allowing the interaction of virtual objects with the real world.

Virtual reality works by using the senses of a person to provide a uniquely immersive experience. The main senses used in VR include touch, sight, and hearing. It also uses the power of the mind. Various features of VR provide users with unique experiences that reconfigure the mind. In most cases, a headset is used to provide such kind of an experience because of its ability to influence the senses of the user.

The five senses of a person are utilized in immersive technologies as follows;
- __Sight:__ In extended reality devices, a computer-created reality is seen by users, which gives them an immersive experience. This occurs because the computer-generated reality is laid in a real-world environment. This visual experience is mostly offered in video games, especially on Playstation and Nintendo gaming platforms. In some museums, 360 degrees of cameras have been mounted on XR headsets to provide users with a unique visual experience.
  
- __Hearing:__ Sounds in XR devices can be heard from all directions. These devices enable users to perceive sound to be in real situations. In football matches of video games, users will hear the sound of football fans, which happens in real life. 
  
- __Touch:__ The sense of touch is integrated into extended reality to improve user experience. In XR devices, gloves and bodysuits are used to give users a sense of touch within the simulation. Wearable devices use haptic technology, which employs a feedback system that helps in the expression of vibrations and motions.
  
- __Taste and Smell:__ These are new fields in extended reality that are undergoing research and development. Scent cartridges are used to provide a sense of smell. These cartridges produce pleasant, neutral and unpleasant scents. Electrodes can be placed on a user's tongue to provide a sense of taste.

### Applications of Extended Reality
Extended reality has a wide range of applications in the modern world. Some of its applications include entertainment, healthcare, education, real estate and marketing. 
#### Entertainment
Extended reality has played a great role in providing immersive technologies in the entertainment world. Users can now get virtual experiences of sports and music events using their VR headsets. In movie theatres, virtual reality has been used to provide audiences with 3D experiences. In acting, real-time rendering and camera tracking provide immersive experiences to actors, which makes them feel as if they are in a real scene. Extended reality is also increasingly being used in video games. There is an improved user experience because of the enhanced comprehensive participation effect.

#### Training and Education
Extended reality helps in facilitating the effective learning of people that may work in high-risk conditions. It could be dangerous to teach new aviation students to fly with real planes. With digital simulations that offer immersive experiences, aviation students can learn how to fly a plane effectively without any potential risk of an accident. Medical students are also using immersive technologies to learn important skills. A good example is the use of virtual patients to gain hands-on experience. 

#### Real Estate
XR can be employed in the real estate sector by offering virtual experiences to potential buyers or tenants. In some cases, tenants or buyers may be far from properties that have been listed for sale. These properties can be viewed virtually to enable users to get a real feel of the assets.

#### Marketing
XR has enabled companies to offer immersive ways in which customers interact with new products. Some companies have also used immersive technologies to allow customers to try products before buying. A good example is Cathay Pacific, which offered its customers a 360-degree video that enabled them to experience its brand firsthand. This strategy enabled the company to increase brand favorability and customer awareness. 

### Current Limitations of XR
Developers of XR technologies are faced with certain challenges that limit their capability. Developing these technologies require the collection and use of huge amounts of personal data that needs to be protected. This spread data may make companies vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Implementing immersive technology is costly, which has barred many companies from investing in extended reality. Companies are required to develop wearable devices that are comfortable and fashionable. Before implementing immersive technologies, developers have to deal with technical issues such as power, connectivity, motion tracking and common illumination. 

### The Future of XR
Extended reality may shape the future of machine-human interactions and digital transformation. The future will have more advanced and complex immersive technologies that will solve many global problems. We may also experience immersive technologies that use the senses of taste and smell. These are technologies that are under extensive research. With the introduction of 5G technology, there will be increased adoption of extended reality in the future. This is because of sustained network performance and uniform experience. Finally, XR could be the future of mobile computing because of its increasing ability to revolutionize mobile experiences. It wouldnâ€™t be surprising to find smartphones becoming XR wearable.
