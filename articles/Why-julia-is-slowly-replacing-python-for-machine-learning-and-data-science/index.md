As the demand for data manipulation and scientific computation arose, so did the need for a better data processing language. A group of mathematicians and computer scientists led by Alan Edelman, Viral B. Shah, Jeff Bezanson, and Stefan Karpinski, noted that the then-existing general-purpose languages were not excellent for logical and arithmetic coding.

### What is Julia Programming Language?
Particularly, there was a lack of a programming language that could perform these tasks at a lightning-fast speed. Thus, they resolved to create a high-performance programming language for machine learning and data science. And that is how [Julia](https://julialang.org/) was introduced. Since its launch in 2012, Julia has become a trendy language among data scientists and mathematicians.

Among the current corporate users of Julia are Aviva and BlackRock. They use this tool to calculate risks and execute time-series analysis, respectively. The Celeste project, which is based on the Julia language set a new scientific record due to its fast speed in cataloguing telescopic data for astronomical objects. The Climate Modeling Alliance, CISCO, QuantEcon, NVIDIA, among others also use Julia. In fact, Julia has become a primary tool in the fields of data science, visualization, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Julia is a worthy competitor for [Python](https://www.python.org/), particularly in the field of arithmetic coding. A preferred tool for developers for many years, Python is facing a threat of a modern programming language. Julia was developed to solve the challenges that Python has. Companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, ILM, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Google and others use Python in one way or another.

### Julia Language Merits

Julia has many features and resources advantageous to machine-learning and data science. This language was designed with a focus on numerical and scientific computation. Julia&#39;s math-friendly syntax makes it ideal for users of [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about), [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), among other computing languages and environments. With its own native machine learning libraries, Julia is expected to attract more data scientists in the future. An example of such a library is [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) and is composed of several model patterns ideal for standard use cases. Flux is entirely written in Julia, meaning that users can implement modifications.

### Python Language Advantages

Unlike Julia, Python is a general-purpose language. Despite not being built purposely for data science, Python offers many advantages to machine-learning and data scientists. Python has existed for around 30 years in which it has established strong relationships with many third-party packages. This has attracted many users. One of the drawbacks associated with Python is speed. Better is that Python is implementing some great improvements, especially to the Python interpreter. Advances in parallel and multi-core processing are intended to make Python easier to speed up.

### Tailored for Machine Learning

Python is used for a broad range of tasks. Julia, on the other hand, is primarily developed to perform machine learning and statistics tasks. Because Julia is explicitly made for high-level statistical work, it has several benefits over Python. In linear algebra, for example, vanilla Julia shows better performance than [vanilla Python](https://pypi.org/project/vanilla/). This is mainly because, unlike Julia, Python does not support all equations and matrices performed in machine-learning. While Python is a great language, especially with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), Julia beats it in when it comes to non-package experience with Julia feeling more catered towards machine learning calculations. The operand system of Julia can only be compared with that of R. That of Python is a bit weaker regarding performance, and that is a big setback.

### Speed

The developers of Julia were motivated to create a programming language with speed. Julia speed matches that of compiled languages like [Fortran](https://www.fortran.com/) and [C](https://www.learn-c.org/). Because it is not an interpreted language, Julia relies on type declarations and just-in-time (JIT) compilation in executing codes involving compilation at run time. With Julia, a developer enjoys great speed without necessarily applying handcrafted profiling and optimization techniques. This makes Julia a solution to performance problems. It is quick to execute codes with Julia considering its complex computational and numerical functions. Not only that, it is developed with a multiple dispatch feature to ensure a quick definition of data types such as arrays and numbers.

Compared to Python, Julia is faster. However, Python developers are on a high note to make improvements to the tool&#39;s speed. Some of the developments that can make Python faster are optimization tools, third-party JIT compilers and external libraries.

### Usage in Data Science

Python is used to perform many tasks, among the most critical being data analytics. One of the reasons why Python is a preferred tool in data science is its favourable ecosystem comprising applications, tools and libraries that make data analysis and computing convenient and fast. That said, considering the rising demand for data analytics and the need to have a better programming language to perform these tasks, Julia language was born. The developers of Julia focused their attention on creating a language dedicated to scientific computing, large-scale linear algebra, machine learning, parallel and distributed computing. Julia improved on Python speed and offered convenience for data scientists to perform computing and analytics with ease.

### Versatility

With Julia, data scientists can write projects from other languages and compile them by sending strings. This happens because Julia is a versatile programming language with universally executable code in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), C, Python, and R. Besides, it takes less time to execute complex and big codes in Julia than in Python. RCall and PyCall are very significant, given that Julia is disadvantaged in terms of packages. This way, you can be able to call on R and Python when the need arises. Important to note is that Python is a reliable tool for web development, automation and scripting. Thus, for a general-purpose language, Python is the better option.

### Tooling and Community Support

Any programing language requires tooling support. Over the years, Python users have enjoyed an active and supportive programming community with enhanced tool support, interfaces and systems built by this community. The support for Julia is still at its first developmental stages. In this case, support for significant resources and debugging tools is minimal.

Equally important for a programming language is community support. Considering that Julia is a relatively new language, the size of its community is small. Interestingly, this community is too enthusiastic and growing day-by-day. Python has been into existent for decades in which extensive community support has gradually developed. A large community means adequate solutions to problems and multiple resources to match developers&#39; needs.

### Conclusion

Python, a well-established language, is very significant to the fields of data science and machine learning. Despite Julia being relatively new with less community and tooling support, it has many advantages over Python. Julia was developed to overcome issues with speed. Its familiarity with C, R, Python, and multiple dispatch environment is a plus.
