 An Application Programming Interface, denoted by API, enables applications to access data and other external software functionalities. APIs are gaining popularity among developers due to their ability to save time and resources. Companies do not need to develop complex systems from scratch. They can opt to consume data from other existing frameworks. Whenever an application requests data, an API can return the appropriate response.

### Introduction

Laravel is one of the popular PHP frameworks. It provides many dependencies that make it easy for developers to work on projects. According to Laravel, they lay the foundation which allows you to focus on more demanding things. Laravel is popular due to its ability to support real-time communication, API authentication, and job queues. This tutorial will teach you how to create an API with Laravel. Since we now know what Laravel is all about, let's dive into the cool stuff.

### Goal of the tutorial

The tutorial seeks to create a simple task manager API using Laravel.

### Prerequisites

You need some basic knowledge of Laravel and PHP to benefit from this tutorial. Furthermore, you must have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) installed on your computer. `Composer` helps download and install the required dependencies. XAMPP is a collection of tools such as Apache Server and MySQL.

### 1. Creating the project

We use the following command to create a new `Laravel` project. You can substitute `taskmanager` with any project name.

```
Laravel new taskmanager.
```

Alternatively, you can use the composer command to create a project as shown.

```
composer create-project â€“prefer-dist Laravel/Laravel taskmanager
```

Ensure that the project you created is in the `xampp/htdocs` folder. You can view your generated website template by visiting `localhost/taskmanager/public/` on your browser.

### 2. Creating the database

Open `Xampp` and launch `phpMyAdmin`. Use it to create a database called `tasks.` We will create tables and insert data using `migrations.` You can now open the Laravel project in your preferred IDE. I will be using `Visual Studio Code.`

Open the `.env file` and change the database name to `tasks.` You can also change the username and password variables depending on your Xampp settings.

### 3. Migration

We use the `php artisan make:model Task -mf ` command to create a model. The &#39;-mf&#39; portion is responsible for generating a task factory and database migration files for this model. The generated files can be found in the migrations and factories folders. Open the ` 2020_11_25_173913_create_tasks_table` file and go to the `up()` function. We need to outline the names of our database columns in the `up()` function. This is shown below.

```php

<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateTasksTable extends Migration{

   /**

    * Run the migrations.

    *

    * @return void

    */

   public function up()  {

       Schema::create('tasks', function (Blueprint $table) {

           $table->id(); //table column
           $table->string('title'); //table column
           $table->string('description');//table column
           $table->timestamps();//table column

       });

   }

   /**

    * Reverse the migrations.

    *

    * @return void

    */

   public function down(){

       Schema::dropIfExists('tasks');

   }

}

```

The database table will have the id, title, description, and timestamps columns. We can perform a migration by using a `php artisan migrate` command in the terminal.

### 4. Seeding data

This stage entails adding some dummy data to our database. Let&#39;s create a `TaskFactory` class by using `php artistan make:factory TaskFactory` command. We need to define the columns that will have fake data. This is done as follows.

```php

'title'=>$this->faker->word,

'description'=>$this->faker->text,

```

The full code of the TaskFactory is shown below.

```php

<?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use App\Models\Task;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class TaskFactory extends Factory

{

   /**

    * The name of the factory's corresponding model.

    *

    * @var string

    */

   protected $model = Task::class;

   /**

    * Define the model's default state.

    *

    * @return array

    */

   public function definition(){

       return [

           'title'=>$this->faker->word,

           'description'=>$this->faker->text,

       ];

   }

}
```

Before we create dummy data, we need to create a `TaskTableSeeder` class. It allows us to determine the amount of dummy data we wish to generate. The `TaskTableSeeder` class is shown below.

```php

<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use App\Models\Task;
use database\factories\TaskFactory;

class TaskTableSeeder extends Seeder{

   /**

    * Run the database seeds.

    *

    * @return void

    */

   public function run(){

       Task::factory()->times(50)->create();//we will generate 50 records

   }

}
```

We state the number of records that should be pre-populated in the database using this `Task::factory()->times(50)->create()` statement. In this case, 50 records will be generated. We can generate the data using `php artisan db:seed` command.

### 5. Controller

The next step is to create a task controller by using `php artisan make:controller TaskController --resource` command. The Controller class helps in handling requests. The created file can be found at `App\http\Controllers\TaskController`. The `--resource` portion allows Laravel to add functions that support CRUD functionalities in the controller. The generated methods are index(), create(), store(), show(), edit(), update().

```php

<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class TaskController extends Controller

{

   /**

    * Display a listing of the resource.

    *

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function index()

   {

       //showing all values present in the database

   }

   /**

    * Show the form for creating a new resource.

    *

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function create(){

       //not required in APIs

   }

   /**

    * Store a newly created resource in storage.

    *

    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function store(Request $request)

   {

       //storing new values in the database

   }

   /**

    * Display the specified resource.

    *

    * @param  int  $id

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function show($id)

   {

       //viewing a particular task from a database

   }

   /**

    * Show the form for editing the specified resource.

    *

    * @param  int  $id

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function edit($id)

   {

       //editing data

   }

   /**

    * Update the specified resource in storage.

    *

    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request

    * @param  int  $id

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function update(Request $request, $id)

   {

       //updating data in the database

   }

   /**

    * Remove the specified resource from storage.

    *

    * @param  int  $id

    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

    */

   public function destroy($id)

   {

       //deleting data

   }

}

```

Let's modify the generated functions to activate CRUD functionalities.

#### a. Index

This method will return all the data or tasks in the database.

```php

  public function index(){

       return Task::orderBy('created_at', 'asc')->get();  //returns all values in the database in ascending order

   }

```

#### b. show

This method allows us to retrieve the values of a specific object

```php

 public function show($id)

   {

       return Task::findorFail($id);//searches for the object in the database using its id and returns it.

   }

```

#### c. store

This method allows us to receive user inputs and store them in the database.

```php

  public function store(Request $request){

       $this->validate($request, [ //ensures that inputs are not empty or null

           'title' => 'required',

           'description' => 'required', 

       ]);

       $task = new Task;

       $task->title = $request->input('title'); //retrieving user inputs

       $task->description = $request->input('description');  //retrieving user inputs

       $task->save(); //storing values as an object

       return $task; //returns the stored value if the operation was successful.

   }

```

#### d. update

This method allows the user to update existing values in the database.

```php

public function update(Request $request, $id){  

         $this->validate($request, [ // the new values should not be null

           'title' => 'required',

           'description' => 'required',

       ]);

       $task = Task::findorFail($id); // uses the id to search values that need to be updated.

       $task->title = $request->input('title'); //retrieves user input

       $task->description = $request->input('description');////retrieves user input

       $task->save();//saves the values in the database. The existing data is overwritten.

       return $task; // retrieves the updated object from the database

```

#### e. destroy

This function is used to delete values in the database. It searches for an object in the database using the provided id and deletes it.

```php

  public function destroy($id){ //receives an object's id

       $task = Task::findorFail($id); //searching for object in database using ID

       if($task->delete()){ //deletes the object

           return 'deleted successfully'; //shows a message when the delete operation was successful.

       }

   }

```

### 6. Registering and listing routes

We can register our Controller in the `api.php` file, as shown below. Note that we do not need to declare all available routes in the project. This is done automatically.

```php
Route::resource('tasks', TaskController::class);
```

We can list the available routes using the command below.

```php
php artisan route:list
```

Here are the available routes in the taskmanager project.

### Conclusion

The `Laravel` framework has made it easy to create powerful and secure APIs quickly. Using the resource command simplifies the routing process. All known routes are added to the application automatically. The framework also provides dependencies for exception and Error handling. Any bug can be traced and resolved.cc
