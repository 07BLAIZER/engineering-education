Language as a method of communication helps people write, read, and speak. Individuals make plans and decisions in natural language, particularly in words. But the current artificial intelligence era is very determined to establish if individuals can communicate in a similar manner with computers. With the goal to ensure that human beings communicate with computers in their natural language, computer scientists have developed natural language processing (NLP) applications. For computers to understand the unstructured and often ambiguous human speech, they require the input of NLP applications.

### Understanding Natural Language Processing

The 21 st century is characterized by automation of systems and gadgets. Moreover, the use of computation is moving to elevated levels. The automation of things that we use daily is targeted to make our lives easier and better. Examples of products of automation include self-driving cars, google assistants, and artificial intelligence in systems. Each of these technologies has deep learning, machine learning or artificial intelligence technologies. Today people are embracing gadgets that rely on machine learning or artificial intelligence, due to their popularity in use in the field of data science, cloud computing, natural language processing, data engineering, computer vision, and more.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a type of AI that seeks to enable computers to process or understand human language. Ideally, NLP does this by programming computers for analyzing and processing large quantities of natural language data. It manipulates speech, text through computational power enabled by the use of various software.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) vs Natural Language Understanding (NLU) vs Natural Language Generation (NLG)

Natural language processing contains algorithms hat help in speech recognition. NLP systems also rely on neural networks to classify texts, answer questions, perform sentimental analysis, among other tasks. A part of NLP is natural language understanding (NLU). In NLU, the program understands, finds meaning and performs a sentimental analysis. This is made possible with the program breaking the language down into small bits that are easily understandable. It also involves an analysis of the text, both syntactically and semantically. Once a smart device, search function or chatbot understands the language it has to talk back in a way that users will understand. This relates to natural language generation (NLG), and its work is to take data from a search result and turn it into understandable language.

Applications of NLP

#### Grammar Checkers

One of the most widely recognized uses of natural language processing is grammar checking. Grammar checkers detect and correct grammatical errors in the input text. They help in language learning, text authoring, and other scenarios. Well, we can check errors through our text manually. But still, a grammar checker would be more effective and faster to note grammatical errors and misspellings while giving suitable suggestions to correct those mistakes.

Writing tools, including Grammarly, WhiteSmoke, and ProWritingAid, rely on the use of NLP to correct grammatical and spelling errors. Grammarly, primarily focuses on a narrow application of artificial intelligence NLP for grammar assistance. Besides grammatical assistance, these tools check for clarity of the text and suggest better synonyms. With these tools, you are sure to improve the readability of the text and hence convey your message most appropriately. Grammar checkers have continued to introduce new features and a tool like Grammarly allows you also to perform a plagiarism check.

#### Chatbots

Strong customer support is a target for every business. But engaging employees to address customers&#39; demands during the day and night might pose various challenges. That is why virtual assistants and chatbots are existing today. Chatbots are replacing the traditional 24/7 support and companies&#39; FAQs. Scientists rely on NLP to train chatbots to behave in a certain way. Efficient chatbots interact and converse with people the way a human being would. Besides, users of systems that utilize chatbots may not even realize that they are not chatting with a real human due to the perfect impression they get. But for these chatbots to work this efficiently, they need the capacity for efficient natural language generation as well as advanced natural processing capabilities. With chatbots becoming more content-sensitive and adequate in personalizing users&#39; experiences, businesses are reaping the benefits of automated customer support services. In addition to query and complaint resolution, chatbots are acting as virtual assistants when it comes to online processes.

#### Search Autocorrect and Autocomplete

Another critical application of NLP is autocomplete. If you start your search on Google, for example, you get many predictions of what you might be interested based on the initial few words or characters that you enter.

![Google Autocomplete and Autocorrect](/engineering-education/articles/5-real-life-use-cases-of-natural-language-processing-(nlp)/Google/Autocomplete/and/Autocorrect.png)

But how does Google suggest relevant keywords? It relies on data that catalogs what other millions of Google users are searching when inputting particular search terms. This is made possible with the use of natural language processing to help understand subtleties between various search terms. Besides, NLP helps make sense of the data.

If you are not well used to the keyboard of your computer or you have a problem hitting the right keys, you will find yourself making many typos or writing incorrect words. If you enable the autocorrect function, you will be able to see the possible search terms or correct typos. Autocorrect also uses NLP technology. With this function, you see the closest possible terms to your misspellings and change the misspelt words to the accurate ones.

#### Machine Translation

Machine translation tools have come to replace the traditional rule-based and dictionary-based language translators. Most machine language tools available in the market today can translate millions of words from one language into another targeted language, which could have been possibly challenging using the traditional way. This change has come with the introduction of powerful machines, the availability of data and evolution in the neural network field. In the current world of globalization, businesses and individuals are taking advantage of language translation tools to break the language barrier and connect to people from different language origins.

#### Analytics

Business decisions are tough to make, and the best decisions are a product of data-driven insights. However, businesses generate large amounts of data and extracting meaningful insights may take a lot of time. To make quick and effective solutions, business people need to be provided with comprehensive information. Data generated from insights can be interpreted using natural language generation- powered tools. Leaders can always consult analytics dashboards powered using NLG for the most recent information that can help them make the nest business decisions.

Many organizations have historically relied on natural language processing (NLP) to perform text analytics and identify patterns in data, including contract review and social media sentiment. Recently, business intelligence and analytics vendors have started to add NLP capabilities to their product offerings. Natural language understanding and Natural language generation, for example, are being used for natural language searches and data visualization narration respectively.
