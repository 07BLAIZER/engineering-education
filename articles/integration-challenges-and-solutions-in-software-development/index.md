The IT industry is growing at a tremendous rate. Thus, there are multiple software being used. There may be various software that needs to be merged to act as a single system. That is where software integration comes in. Software integration is one of the most important phases during software development. This is because most of the hidden problems of other phases start to appear in this phase. Integrating these technologies and systems is not easy. It is a challenge IT persons often face in their companies. This article looks at software integration challenges in software development. Also, you will learn the practices needed to overcome system integration challenges.

### Software Integration
Software integration is the process of joining different software and subsystems to create a single system. It has mainly replaced the manual way of doing things. Also, it has made it possible for all functions to be operated from a single system.

Integration improves business operations and processes, productivity, and quality of the final product. It enables IT systems to talk to each other. Thus speeding up information flows and reduce operating costs.

There are four various ways to achieve software integration. They are;

+ [Vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration)
It is a software integration method where subsystems of a network are joined according to their functionalities.

+ [Star integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#:~:text=Star%20integration%2C%20also%20known%20as,each%20of%20the%20remaining%20subsystems.&amp;text=This%20allows%20cutting%20the%20costs%20of%20integration%20and%20provides%20extreme%20flexibility.)
It is when a system's subsystems connect with other subsystems through point-to-point connections.

+ [Horizontal integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_integration#:~:text=Horizontal%20integration%20is%20the%20process,for%20that%20product%20or%20service.)
It is where a subsystem is used as an interface for other subsystems. The subsystem used as an interface is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). An advantage of this method is that it is easy to change a subsystem without interfering with other subsystems.

+ [Common data integration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration)
It set down an application-independent format. All data is in a single format. Systems that use this technique can have a service that converts applications to the [common application](https://biz-techservices.com/the-importance-of-system-integration-in-businesses/).

### Why Is Software Integration Important?
The software integration process is facilitated by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). They are functions and procedures which facilitate interaction between different software intermediaries. Below are some reasons why integrating software is important.

1. Improved accessibility of data

When software or systems are integrated, they form a single system. This means that the data is in one place, which in turn eases data accessibility. Employees can access data anytime without looking for help or being familiar with the systems in a company. Improved accessibility enables cost reduction and saving time.

2. Error reduction

With software integration, errors are few because of data synchronization. Without software integration, there would be scattered data or manual movement of data. Scattered data lacks uniformity. In case of changes, they have to be done in all the data locations. In a single system, databases are synchronized and hence accurate and complete. The movement of data is automatic in integrated systems, which minimize errors.

3. Quicker business processes

For corporations and businesses, software integration ensures faster business processes. Studies show that customers do not like to wait. They like a faster service provider. With software integration, all the data is in the same place. Therefore, data is easily accessible, and clients are served faster. There is no manual entry of data with integrated systems, which means that it is more accurate.

4. Improves security

Data security is a major concern in the IT industry. This is mainly because the cloud is a new technology that has not been scrutinized like other technologies. Software integration improves security. This is because employees can only access data from an integrated system. Therefore, there is efficiency and better data flow; thus, data breaches are minimized.

5. Reduction of costs

This is the most obvious advantage of software integration. Due to the automation of tasks, costs are reduced as compared to manually handling tasks. Accessing data from scattered locations and unsynchronized databases is costly and also erroneous. Integrated systems reduce the cost of correcting errors.

7. High employee productivity

Without software integration, employees will have to move data manually around different tools. This is time-consuming. Looking for resources and necessary information to do their jobs is tedious. Systems having data in a central location reduces time and complexity. Hence improving employee productivity.

8. Better data flow

With integrated systems, there is no manual movement of data. It is automatic. Manual movement of data is unproductive and time-consuming. There are no overlapped databases in integrated systems. The data is real-time data because of synchronization, which means [better data flow](https://learn.g2.com/reasons-to-integrate-software).

### Challenges in Software Integration

#### Picking the right integration tool
There are many tools for software integration. Choosing one is, therefore, a challenge because most of them promise the best service. Today, a software integration tool that supports hybrid integration is most preferred. Hybrid integration allows for an application to integrate with cloud-based integration. They are preferred because developers may not want to go completely on the cloud for security and privacy concerns.

#### Integrating with monolithic systems
Many enterprises have [monolithic architecture systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_system#:~:text=A%20software%20system%20is%20called,than%20containing%20architecturally%20separate%20components.). Therefore, it is not possible to do away with those systems efficiently. Organizations heavily depend on monolithic systems, as they are mostly [legacy systems](https://www.youredi.com/blog/legacy-system-integration). Replacing these systems for the sake of integration is difficult. Thus it becomes a challenge.

#### Changes in the environment
Integrated softwares usually are not the same. Today, nothing stays the same for a long period of time. Most integrated systems are designed to solve a particular problem. Also, components and subsystems integrated may not be well prepared for integration. Such systems are unable to keep up with changes and become obsolete.

### Success Factors for Software Integration
There are keys to ensuring successful software integration. They are as follows.

#### Security
Security is a major concern in IT. For successful integration, it is important to ensure that it takes place over secure lines such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). Integrations should also be audit trailed. An audit trail is a record of documented activities to show what is happening during the integration process. It is also important to be able to disable integration in case of a compromise of security.

#### Keep your software or system simple.
Systems work well and effectively when they are simple rather than when they are complex. When integrating systems, use the [KISS (Keep it simple stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle. Do not risk using the [big design up front (BDUF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front) development because of the level of complexity. To be safe, break it down and build what you need when you want it. Through this, you will be able to overcome system integration challenges.

#### Application Analysis
This involves analyzing the proposed system integration&#39;s needs and gathering all relevant information to be used in the process. It also involves analyzing the success factors for the integration and how to achieve them.

#### Go for smaller integrations over extensive integrations.
Small and straightforward integrations are more powerful. They hardly create any dependencies other than large and complicated solutions.

#### Flexibility
Software integrations can either be file-based integration or be achieved through web services. File-based integration involves sharing data between two different software. They are done manually and through:

+ File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
+ Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

The best software integration is through web services. To achieve integration, data flows between platforms. Flexible web services can support [Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [Representational State Transfer (REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) standards. Integration should be able to be moved from file-based integration to web services integration.

### Conclusion
Software integration, as seen, is complex but very vital to today&#39;s technology. We learned integration combines different technologies or systems to achieve goals. Although it is complex, it is has solved many problems and simplified many operations.
