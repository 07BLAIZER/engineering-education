`Flutter` is an open-source UI software development kit that `Google` released in 2018. It uses Dart as its primary programming language. Flutter has led to the emergence of new software developers called `Flutter Developers`. 

### Introduction

Cross-platform applications enable companies to cut down on development costs. They eliminate the need to hire different software development teams. They also reduce the time and cost to manage different code bases. Flutter enables developers to create cross-platform applications. 

Due to these reasons, the need for Flutter Developers will continue to increase.

### Who is a Flutter Developer

A Flutter developer is a software developer who uses the Flutter framework to develop cross-platform applications. 

### Roles and Responsibilities of a Flutter Developer

1. **To Code Applications.**

It is the process of writing the code to develop software. Flutter developers use the Flutter SDK to craft beautiful and interactive applications.

2. **TO Test Applications.**

They test the functionality of the applications to make sure they do not crash. Testing ensures that apps are running well based on the system and user requirements.

3. **To Deliver Applications.**

It involves releasing a complete application to the public. A mobile app is placed on `PlayStore` for Android applications or `AppleStore` for iOS applications. The feedback from the users is monitored and used to make changes to the applications.


### Flutter Developer Tools

1. **Version Control Tools**

These tools allow software developers to keep track of changes they make on their projects. They also boost collaboration among software developers. This paves the way for increased productivity. 

Examples of version control tools:

[Git and Github](https://github.com/) - To use git and github you will need to install git to the code editor or IDE you are using and have an existing github account. All you need to do is write git commands to push your code to a github repository. From the repository other developers can help you improve your code. You can also set your repository as private.

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

2. **Flutter Framework**

Flutter is a UI framework used to develop high performance and high-quality native applications for Android, iOS, web and desktop using a single code base. Dart is the primary programming language for Flutter Framework. 

Some features of Flutter that make it popular include 

1. `Hot Reloading` which enables developers to load code changes quickley and preserves the state of the app. 
2. `Hot Restart`. This is similar to hot reloading but causes the app to lose its state and takes more time.
3. `Present UI element` to create beautiful app designs for better `UI and UX`. 

These UI designs are 
1. Cupertino 
2. Material Design. 

These built-in features make building Flutter applications fast in performance. 


3. **Integrated Development Environment**

In using Flutter, you will choose between three IDEs. Which are:
- Android Studio.
- Visual Studio Code.
- IntelliJ IDEA.

Most Flutter developers pick either Android Studio and Visual Studio Code. They chose IDEs depending on the features suitable to them. Android Studio and Visual Studio Code are both capable of creating full Flutter apps, developer preferences aside.

4. **Flutter DevTools**

It is a tooling web suite for Flutter and Dart developers comprising a layout inspection tools, performance tools and memory tools. It contains all the debugging tools that you need to be an efficient and effective Flutter developer.

Some of tools in the [Flutter DevTools web suite](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/overview) include:

1. Flutter Inspector - It is used to diagnose and debug layout issues.

2. Timeline - It diagnoses performance problems which are the most common kinds during development. The Timeline shows the amount of time taken by each widget.


5. **Design Tools**

These are tools used to craft and visualize ideas. Design is an important stage of app development. It ensures for a smooth software development process. Some software development teams include UI/UX designers, especially for building commercial applications while others lack. Building personal projects will also need knowledge of design tools.

Here are some of the most popular design tools:
- [Sketch.](https://www.sketch.com/) This is however only available for Mac.
- [Adobe XD.](https://www.sketch.com/)
- [Figma.](https://www.figma.com/) 
- [Flutter Studio.](https://flutterstudio.app/)

After designing, you can use [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/) to convert the design into code by exporting it. You will, however, need to refactor the exported code to break it into readable code. Supernova is compatible with the design tools mentioned above. 

### Flutter Developer Skills

1. **Dart Programming Language**

`Dart` is a client-based programming language that is scalable and can be used to write simple scripts. It is an object-oriented and dynamic language. Google developed dart. It is the primary language used in Flutter development.

2. **Knowledge on Agile Methodology and Waterfall for Software Development**

A software development method is dividing the software development process into different phases. It enhances product design and resource utilization ***for example*** money and time. 

The most commonly used methodologies are `Waterfall Methodology` and `Agile Methodology`. A Flutter developer needs to familiarize themselves with the software methodologies to work with ease in a software development team.

`Waterfall Methodology` is a system development life cycle model used to create a system with a linear and sequential approach.
`Agile Methodology` is also a system development life cycle model that implements the practice of iteration during testing and development throughout the cycle.

3. **Prior knowledge on a Native Language**

The native languages for mobile application development include:

1. `Swift` for iOS applications.

2. `Java` and `Kotlin` for Android applications.

Understanding these languages will make it easier to become a flutter developer.

### Mistakes to Avoid When Learning Flutter Development

- **Learn native languages, not just Flutter and Dart.**

Most software developers will argue that prior knowledge in a native language is unnecessary, but it is a skill requirement on most job descriptions. Flutter development is still fairly new, and employers must have proof that you know about application development. The only way to show this is by having experience with native languages such as Java, Swift, or Kotlin.

Knowing a native language will give you an advantage over a person who only knows flutter and dart. It will display a variety of expertise and knowledge. A grasp on native languages will make it easier to move flutter development.

- **Do not over-rely on one source to develop your career as a Flutter Developer.**

Flutter and Dart are still fairly new technologies. Finding a single tutorial or reading material to kick off your career might not give you sufficient knowledge. It is advisable to look into multiple resources to get a good grasp of Flutter and Dart. Different tutors have unique experiences and information on the framework and programming language.

- **Do not learn Flutter in general, pick an app to develop from scratch upwards.**

Avoid confusion when trying to get into a new profession. Do not learn the framework generally, instead find an example of an application you would like build from scratch upwards. It will allow you to make mistakes, learn from them, and have an actual project to add into your portfolio. Building such apps from scratch helps you acquire critical skills and experiences. These attributes can help in the creatio of more powerful applications.


### Getting a job as a Flutter Developer

2. #### Flutter Developer Interview Questions Example

Technical questions a Flutter Developer gets during an interview are mostly categorised into two:

1. **Written Questions.**

They mostly test your knowledge on `Dart Programming Language`. Its data structures, algorithms, control flows, and general knowledge in the programming language.

2. **Verbal Questions.**

These questions will test your knowledge on Flutter framework. They may also include questions on Dart Programming Language.
