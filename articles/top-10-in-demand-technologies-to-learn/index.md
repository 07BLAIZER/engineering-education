# Top-10-In-Demand-Technologies-to-Learn
Technology is evolving rapidly and IT professionals are keeping themselves updated with the current trends. As an IT professional it is almost like a survival tactic to keep yourself updated with the ever-evolving technologies as well as the market trends. This means deciding what you want in the future, the jobs you qualify to do, and the skills you need to gather [simplilearn]([https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article)).

Technology has helped to do almost every aspect of life. It is not only changing the world at a tremendous rate but also advancing towards making it a better place to live in. Technology has come a long way in recent decades, Its development has paved the way to expand the worlds outlook leading to some groundbreaking innovations.

Without further ado, here are 10 technologies in-demand that enable IT professionals to gain skills.

1. Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence or AI is the simulation of intelligence in programmed computer systems to mimic their actions perform tasks such as object recognition, voice recognition, face recognition, decision-making, and patterns. AI can perform these tasks more quickly and accurately than human beings.AI pertains machines working and behaving like humans or acting intelligently like humans.

AI is being used in almost every business sector to reduce human intervention such as cybersecurity. It detects breaches and increases the efficiency of security analysts, reduces the time they spend analyzing fake positives, and improves productivity.

AI in simpler terms means automation, automation creates more jobs as well as eliminate them. According to [simplilearn]([https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article)), automation will eliminate 73 million jobs and create 23 million jobs. The jobs created by AI will be development, programming, testing, support, and maintenance.

2. Cyber Security

Cybersecurity is a major concern for most companies. Learning Cyber Security gives you the know-how to protect networks, computer operating systems, and data from cyber-attacks [geeksforgeeks]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-technology-trends-that-you-can-learn-in-2020/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-technology-trends-that-you-can-learn-in-2020/)). The primary agenda of learning cybersecurity is to earn the technical skills necessary to prevent malicious individuals from destroying data and conducting attacks.

Top organizations increase security budget year by year to stop malicious threats, cyber-attacks, remove vulnerabilities, defend against security breaches, and protect their data from data breaches, data manipulation, and data theft.

Learning cybersecurity will be very beneficial to you because cybersecurity jobs are in demand, in the field of security jobs are more compared to other tech fields. This is evidence that more cybersecurity professionals are needed.

3. UI/UX Design

User Interface and User Experience design or simply UI/UX design is a design-centric approach that offers practical skills. A UI designer is concerned about how the product is laid out. UI designers design interfaces for web apps and mobile apps to be visually appealing, have a good flow and enable users to navigate easily. UX designer is more concerned about how the product feels. They do research and testing elements behavior on the interface to make sure that the flow is good [fastcompany]([https://www.fastcompany.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry](https://www.fastcompany.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry)).

UI is good for those who want to focus on visuals, layout, the general look, and the feel of the product. On the other hand, UX will suit those who want to use analysis and testing to help users meet their needs.

4. Internet of Things

IoT is the interconnection of computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, animals, objects, and people that are provided with unique identifiers. IoT enables the data transfer over a network without requiring the human to the computer or human-to-human interaction, in other words, IoT connects objects to the internet and allow communication to take place. Whether its the curtains, cars, door, refrigerator, and home appliances. Sensors are installed to the objects, these sensors are used to communicate and send data to the cloud.

According to [geeksforgeeks]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet-of-things-iot-set-1/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet-of-things-iot-set-1/)), IoT will soon turn Nature to be a Smart Nature. According to statistics recorded in 2017, the number of devices using IoT reached 8.4 billion, in 2020 the number of IoT devices is expected to reach 30 billion [simplilearn]([https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article](https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article)). Learning IoT is vital because more IT workers are needed.

5. Robotics Process Automation

Like AI, Robotics Process Automation or RPA is going to revolutionize the way organizations work today. RPA is the automation of business processes such as processing transactions, data replication, and sending or processing emails from multiple customers emails with the help of robots to reduce human intervention. RPA is an evolving technology, which involves tasks that are repetitive and can be automated. With RPA, we can reduce human error, save time, and reduce operating costs. RPA technology is growing fast and is widely used in industries such as manufacturing, analytics, and data entry jobs.

Skills needed to become an RPA developer are python, Java, AI and ML, MySQL, and Scala.

6. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality

Virtua Reality (VR) is the technology, which immerses the user in an environment which makes you believe that you are in a completely different environment while AR enhances the environment. The VR and AR skills are on-demand, to get started with these technologies, programming skills are important and a forward-thinking mindset.

7. Cognitive Cloud Computing

Cognitive Cloud Computing is one of the next big things in the IT industry. It can converse in natural language and help in decision-making. This technology uses the idea of Man and Machine together in one, It has made computers smart enough to function like human brains. Businesses are deploying cloud computing applications and solutions in their processes.

8. BlockChain

BlockChain is another top emerging technology. Blockchain is a list of e records called blocks that are linked together using cryptography. It is used to facilitate transactions of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchain increases security and speeds up the exchange of information cost-effectively and transparently [geeksforgeeks]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/)).

Blockchain engineers jobs are increasingly in demand. Skills needed to become a Blockchain developer are Python, Cryptography, Internet Security, Large codebases, C/C++, No SQL databases and Relational databases

9. Big Data Analytics

Big Data refers to extremely large amounts of data that can be used to reveal patterns, trends, insights, and associations if analyzed properly. Hadoop and Spark are frameworks for solving Big Data problems and analyzing the data. Having Big Data knowledge and skills is vital [edureka]([https://www.edureka.co/big-data-hadoop-training-certification](https://www.edureka.co/big-data-hadoop-training-certification)).

10. Edge Computing

Edge Computing is a technology designated by many applications applied in industries. It is computing that takes place at the edge of corporate networks. This technology is used to process sensitive and delicate data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations edge computing act like mini datacenters[simplilearn]([https://www.simplilearn.com/edge-computing-vs-cloud-computing-article](https://www.simplilearn.com/edge-computing-vs-cloud-computing-article)).
