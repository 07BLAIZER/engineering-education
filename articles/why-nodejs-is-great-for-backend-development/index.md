### Introduction.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn) backend development is not a new concept and has been used to implement many digital products online. It comes with many benefits making it suitable for building enterprise and [business to customer](https://www.biztechcs.com/blog/business-consumer-application/) applications.

Every programmer is aware of the concept of JavaScript, and its popularity has continued to rise significantly. Some tasks were not
imaginable, whether possible to accomplish some years back, but it is now possible with JavaScript.

[JS](https://www.javascript.com/) is a backend technology built in JavaScript. It is great since it speeds up the development, making it more time and cost-effective by unifying the [codebase](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23962/codebase).

Node.js is a JavaScript framework and a runtime environment that runs JavaScript code outside the web browser.

JS is a programming language that drastically changed web development and has been in use by IT specialists worldwide since [1995](https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/). Even though JS has been around for a long and has great [frameworks](https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-a-javascript-framework/) and [libraries](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/using-js-libraries-in-your-webpage/a/the-world-of-js-libraries), it has never had any backend platforms, which could compete with other languages. Node.js came to solve this issue, and now many startups and enterprise-level projects use Node.js for various reasons.

The research shows that developers use Node.js for their application’s [backend](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/front-end-development-vs-back-end-development-where-to-start) and other tasks to enhance their performance.

### What is Node.js used for?
Node.js belongs to the software category that allows developers to code applications and later runs them. The principal characteristics of Node.js are:

-   It is a server framework.

-   It is [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).

-   It is suitable for different platforms.

Node.js server processes are executed in the below order:

1.  A task is set to server.

2.  The file system receives the task from the server.

3.  The system awaits the request.

4.  The request is made to the system, and a file is processed and sent to the user.

### Main Competitors of Node.js in Backend Development.

[PHP](https://www.php.net/)

It is widely used by programmers for backend development, suitable for mid-sized projects, and can be used for large projects. Unlike in Node.js, the PHP architecture depends on events making real-time connections challenging to achieve.

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

Python is easy to learn and therefore popular among aspiring new programmers. It is best for mid-sized and large software projects. Compared to Node.js in terms of performance, Python does not do well, although it is great for building projects that are fast, productive, and with good outcomes.

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

It is best suited for both small and mid-sized projects. It comes with good documentation and also has a vast community of developers supporting it. It has dropped its market share and popularity among the community in recent years, translating to fewer updates and implementations, which is not the case compared with Node.js.

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)

It is a programming language that comes with numerous frameworks hence high in demand. It is suitable for large enterprise projects that need complex and complicated computations and data processing. The comparison in terms of development time between Node.js and Java is that Node.js is easier to learn than Java, leading to fast development when using Node.js compared to Java.

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

It is a robust Microsoft framework with a wide range of languages suitable for back-end and front-end development. It is most effective for both small and mid-sized projects. It is free, multi-platform and supports services, websites, and desktop application development.

In .NET, a developer can write [sync](https://adrianmejia.com/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-handling-concurrency-in-javascript/) or [async](https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html) code, depending on preference. In Node.js, the developer has to use async code, meaning Node.js care about maximizing CPU efficiency by eliminating [thread context switching](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~narten/110/nachos/main/node13.html).

### Node.js Frameworks.
Some tasks are still challenging to perform with Node.js, and thus, many frameworks have been developed to ease the work. The popular Node.js frameworks are as follows:

[Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) – It is an advanced Node.js framework for the backend that is suitable for building enterprise-level projects. It has a wide range of libraries that implements [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html), Model-View-Presenter ([MVP](https://medium.com/@anshul.vyas380/model-view-presenter-b7ece803203c)), and combined principles of Object-Oriented-Programming ([OOP](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)), Function-Point ([FP](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-functional-point-fp-analysis)), and Functional-Reactive-Programming ([FRP](https://modernweb.com/functional-reactive-programming-in-javascript/)).

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) – It is quick, minimal design, and with a robust collection of HTTP helpers. It is preferred to the developers who do not have a lengthy and costly process of development. It is also best for the development of APIs, mobile and web applications.

[Socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/) – It has a user-friendly that makes it easy to use on multi-devices. It focuses on bi-directional real-time connections. It also supports [reconnection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reconnecting-websocket), [binary](https://blog.takeer.com/streaming-binary-data-using-socket-io/), and [multiplexing](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/multiplexing#:~:text=Multiplexing%20(or%20muxing)%20is%20a,called%20demultiplexing%20(or%20demuxing).).

[Meteor.js](https://guide.meteor.com/) – provides real-time features, dynamic imports, integration between front-end and back-end, and protection from hidden APIs.

[Koa.js](https://koajs.com/#introduction) – It uses async functions, eases the error handling process, and enhances the application's performance.

[Loopback.io](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/) – It allows the developer to build an API fast, as it provides numerous features that simplify the working process. It supports ad-hoc queries and storage services. It supports various REST services and many common known databases.

[Feathers.io](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/) – It allows the writing of real-time web applications and [REST APIs](https://restfulapi.net/) with less effort.

Among the above-listed frameworks, the developer can find the best Node.js framework that suits their project's requirements and hence better results.

### Why Node.js good for Backend?
In web development, the backend of any application is the most crucial part. Thus, developers pay attention to it and utilize the best solutions and technology to work correctly.

Node.js works well with a real-time and **large amount of information**. Note that HTTP requests and responses are large streams of data. Node.js enables the collection and visualization of data to be presented as dashboards.

Node.js backend development is **concise** as it provides many features that can be impossible to have with any event-based environments.

Node.js is **fast** as it stores its data in [native JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-json). It is supported by **a large community of developers** that constantly work on improving it. Also, it performs high-level **data streaming**. It is also suitable for developing software for **different platforms** regardless of the underlying operating system.

Node.js handles **simultaneous tasks** since it is [non-blocking](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/) and supports [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). They help speed up the server activities because the processes are usually handled in a single thread instead of queuing.

Applications developed in Node.js can be scaled and offers relatively higher **performance**.

With Node.js, which is **easy to learn**, the number of developers who use Node.js is significantly growing, reducing development costs while hiring them.
