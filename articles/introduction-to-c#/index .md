### Introduction to C#
C# is an Object-Oriented programming language and it is portable as it can develop software for many computers. It requires a .NET framework on the machine for it to run. C# language was invented in 2002 and it is one of the programming languages widely used today.

C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp".

The performance of C# is exceptional in terms of speed and it uses very few resources. Many applications can be created using C#. Some of the applications that can be created with C# are:

- Web applications
- Networking applications
- Database applications
- Mobile application
- Games
- Service applications 


C# is a unique language that is friendlier and easier to understand.

Programs written in C# utilize the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45) to run. .NET is a framework used to make applications and run the .NET software. It was created by Microsoft and it runs primarily on Windows operating system. There is an open-source too called [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) which runs a cross-platform.
In this tutorial, we will use it to compile and run our C# code.

To get started, you will need:

An IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for writing and compiling code. We will be using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).



### Installing C# 
After you have installed Visual Studio, choose .NET desktop development and click *Modify*.
![vscode](installation.png)

After the installation, click *Launch* to get started.  

On the new window, choose *Create new project*.
![newproject](vs1.png)

Once you have selected *Create new project*, choose *"Install more tools and features"* then click *Next*.

![newproject](Newproject2.png)

Choose *Console App (.NET Core)* from the list and click *Next*.

![newproject](Consoleapp.png)

Enter your preferred project name and click *Create*. In this case, I will name my file *HelloWorld*.

![newproject](projectname.png)

Visual Code will automatically generate some code of C# for you.

![newproject](Program.png)

Let's look at the code.

Below is the code that will be generated. It is a *Hello World* program.

```C#
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
        {
            class Program
            {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            }
        }
    }
```

For you to run the program, press the *F5* key on your keyboard.
This will compile and run your code. A  console window will open with the following output:

```
Hello World!

C:\Users\Username\source\repos\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\HelloWorld.exe (process 13784) exited with code 0.
To automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.
Press any key to close this window . . .
```

### C# Syntax

From the above code that was generated by Visual Studio, let us look at each line of code:

**Line 1:** 

 ```C#
 using System;
 ```

In C#, it means that we can use the classes available in the system. It contains commonly-used types and classes. 
You can explore more in the [C# docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive).

**Line 2:**
 ```C#
 namespace HelloWorld {
    // code declarations
}
 ``` 

Namespaces are used in C# to separate and organize code. They are containers consisting of methods, classes, and other namespaces.

**Line 3:**
 ``` C#
 class Program {
    // code declarations
}
 ```

A class is a container that contains methods and data. Since C# is Object-oriented programming, creating a class is mandatory for each program. In our case, we are creating a class called `Program`.

**Line 4:** 
```C#
static void Main(string[] args) {
    // code
}
```
Execution of a program begins from the `Main` method. Every C# program must have the `Main` method.

**Line 5:**
 ```C#
 Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
 ```

`Console.WriteLine()` is used to print out text on the console. It prints a string and it adds a new line character to the end of the string. In our case, it is used to output *"Hello World"*.

We can also use `Console.Write()` to print a string **but** it does not add a new line character to the end of the string.  You can learn more on Console.WriteLine() and Console.Write() [here](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/basic-input-output).

### Reading character(s) from the input:

`Console.ReadLine()` is used to read the next **characters** in the input system.

`Console.Read()` is used to read the next **character** in the input system.

`Console.ReadKey()` is used to obtain the **next key** entered by the user. It is mostly used to hold the console for the user until he presses a key.

### Comments in C#

**Example**
```c#
//This is a C# program
```

The line starts with two forward slashes which makes it a comment. The compiler ignores comments when compiling the code. This is a single-line comment. Comments are used by programmers to explain more about the line(what the line does). This concept is so important when a group of programmers is working together as it makes your code more readable to the others.

For multiple-line comment,we use ` /*`and ends with `*/` :

```C#
/* C# is a programming language used to create Web applications and Mobile applications.

It is an amazing language. */
```

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler.


**Note:**
- Each line in C# ends with a semi-colon(;).
- C# follows a top to bottom order when executing the program.
- C# is case-sensitive as it treats Uppercase and Lowercase characters differently. e.g `program` and `Program` are different things.

**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first C# program.

Let's write another program that adds two numbers entered by the user.
```C#
//This is a C# program that adds two numbers
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
        {
            class Program
            {       
                static void Main(string[] args)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Enter your first number: ");
                    int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                    Console.WriteLine("Enter your second number: ");
                    int num2= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                    int sum = num1 + num2;//adds the two numbers
                    Console.WriteLine("Your Sum is " + sum);//prints the sum of the two numbers 
                    Console.ReadKey();
               }
         }
    }

```


Here's how your program output will look like:

```
Enter your first number: 2

Enter your second number: 5

Your Sum Is 7
```
Let us look at the new things in our program:

```c#
int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
```
It takes data from the user and allocates it to the memory location.

`int num1` means that we are creating a memory location to hold an integer (int). In our case, we have named the memory location as **num1**.

Just like integers, we have `double` data type which stores fractional numbers:
```C#
double num1;
```

When we prompt the user to enter any details, C# takes the input as strings therefore, we have to convert the strings to numbers using the `Convert.ToInt32()` method above. 

```C#
Console.ReadLine()
```
It is a function that returns the value from the Input system.
