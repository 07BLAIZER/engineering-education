In our lives, we heavily rely on digital assistants to make our work easier and faster. The statistics of people using digital assistants is growing so fast, and the anticipation is that the numbers will continue to rise even further.

There are [4.2 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/973815/worldwide-digital-voice-assistant-in-use/#) digital assistant units worldwide today, and forecasts indicate that the number will increase to 8.4 billion by 2024, which&#39;s higher than today&#39;s world population.

Digital assistants are very easy and convenient to use, but the technology surrounding us is ever rapidly evolving and advancing making digital assistants limited. Due to the limited nature of digital assistants, the need for more seamless, dynamic, and all-around assistants of its kind arises. This has led to the natural evolution of digital assistants known as digital companions.

This article provides an extensive comparison and interrelatedness between digital assistants and digital companions. It enumerates their applications in a real-life situation, their benefits, and future expectation.

### An overview of digital assistants

Digital assistants is an advanced computer program that simulates a conversation with the people who use it, mostly over the internet. Digital assistants use the following to provide a personalized conversation experience;

1. Artificial Intelligence ([IA](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/artificial-intelligence-future/)) – Simulation of human intelligence through programming in a machine to mimic human actions.
2. Natural Language Processing ([NLP](https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/)) – refers to automatic manipulation of a natural language such as speech and text through software.
3. [Machine Language](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/machlang.htm) – refers to a collection of binary digits or bits that a machine can understand.

Just as the word digital assistant implies, their primary purpose is to assist us in our daily tasks, thus providing short-cuts, quick information, automate, and simplify routines.

We use digital assistants in various forms, like in our smartphones, speakers, etcetera. Most of us have a fair share of interaction with digital assistants in various shapes and forms. The interaction of digital assistant takes place through hands-free [Voice User Interfaces](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/voice-user-interfaces) (a system that allows users to interact through voice or speech commands) and text or visuals. Examples of digital assistants we use today are plus [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/), [Alexa](https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-alexa/), and Google.

Digital assistants are affordable, convenient, and user-friendly and are primarily used to save time and carry commands. They respond to our requests reactively rather than engaging us proactively.

### An overview of digital companions

Digital companions are just new and improved digital assistants. In a way, they assist us in numerous tasks, and they do so in a personalized, seamless, and fun manner. They are interactive to the user. Digital companions learn and remember over time what we like or dislike each time we interact, that is, individual preferences and needs. They also assist us in understanding and choosing, among many options, the best course of action. In other words, digital companions interact with us proactively as opposed to digital assistants, which do so reactively.

Digital companions have a two way direction relationship with its users based on the following; empathy, trust, and anticipation of needs and preferences. They make suggestions that fit our interests and positively influence our behaviors.

Digital companions are used to automate management and employee experience, thereby making it more accessible. It is also used in performing common tasks such as resetting passwords, system status updates, and outage alerts.

### A comparison of digital assistants and digital companions

- Digital assistants&#39; interactions are primarily command-based but those of digital companions are both proactive and command-based.
- Digital assistants create short and one-sided exchanges; digital companions create more extended and bidirectional exchanges.
- Digital assistants use a single primary modality, for instance, voice or text; digital companions use multiple modalities, e.g., voice, movements.
- Digital assistants are more of generic character and less personality; digital companions are personalized for each user.
- Digital assistants&#39; experiences are homogenous for all users; digital companions&#39; experiences are personalized for each individual.
- Digital assistants&#39; actions are executed based on users&#39; commands; digital companions&#39; actions are executed based on context and goals.
- Digital assistants incorporate very little information about the user while digital companions remember users` needs and preferences.

### Applications of digital companions

The applications of digital companions, especially as far as the future is concerned, are vast; this is because of technology evolution. Digital companions are applied but not limited to the following field;

- Education and training field, for example in computations, spelling checks, study reviews etcetera.
- Automotive and mobility, for example one can ask the locations of refiling station and directions.
- Banking and finance, in Automatic Machines (ATMs)
- Retail and hospitality, for instance, processing orders
- Digital assistants can be used in-home care tasks and chores, for example, in smart homes, smart appliances, etcetera.
- Healthcare and medicine, used in patient tracking, medical referencing and dosage.

### Benefits of using digital assistants and digital companions

- Offers more services to the employees and customers to generate more routine service desk or customer service requests.
- They are economical; they are less expensive compared to human resources performing the same job.
- They are more efficient and convenient.
- Learn with time, through experience

### Conclusion

Due to the rampant technology evolution, it&#39;s only a matter of time for the digital assistants to evolve to the next form; digital companions. Digital companions will create an entirely new experience for us. For example, the way we relate to technology will change; thus, creating more seamless, fun, and personalized experiences.
