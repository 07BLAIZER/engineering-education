In this tutorial, we will be building a server using Node.js and Express to initiate, query and stop cloud recording of audio/video streams occuring in your application using the APIs provided by Agora.

### Goals
By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll know:

- How Agora's cloud recording works.

- The difference between cloud recording and on-premise recording.

- How to set up an Express server to initiate, query and stop cloud recording.

### Prerequisites
This tutorial is for applications that use [Agora](https://www.agora.io/) and want to implement cloud recording. If you are not using Agora in your application, then this tutorial is not for you.

If you'd like to learn how to build some applications with React Native and Agora, refer to the articles below.
- [Livestreaming](/engineering-education/react-native-agora-livestreaming-app/).

- [Video Conferencing](/engineering-education/react-native-agora-video-conference-app/).

The fundamentals of Node.js and Express will not be covered in this tutorial. If you are not comfortable with the fundamentals, this is a [helpful tutorial](https://medium.com/@jaeger.rob/introduction-to-nodes-express-js-db5617047150) that you can go through before beginning with this project.

### Agora
Agora.io was founded in 2014. It's a service provider for real-time voice and video. Its core technology is real-time communication (RTC).

Agora provides SDKs to build apps that require real-time engagement like:

- Audio/Video Calls.

- Interactive Livestreaming (Audio/ Video).

- Interactive Gaming.

- Real-Time Messaging (which is in BETA at the time of writing this article).

Agora is a paid service, but the first 10,000 minutes are free every month. You can check their pricing [here](https://www.agora.io/en/pricing/).

If you'd like to learn more about Agora, visit their [website](https://www.agora.io/en/) or read [this article](https://equalocean.com/analysis/201904121773).

This tutorial is for developers who have already developed an application using Agora SDKs and want to record audio/video streams.

### Overview
We'll be going through these steps in this article:

1. Cloud recording vs. On-Premise recording.
2. Enabling Cloud Recording in Project management console.
3. Acquiring Authentication Keys for Agora APIs.
4. Setting up the server.
5. Start a recording.
6. Query a recording.
7. Stop a recording.
8. Recap.

### Cloud recording vs. On-Premise recording.
