### Graphs: Introduction
Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of two major components:

- **Vertices** -- Vertices are entities in a graph. Every vertex has a value associated with it. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the vertices would represent cities.

- **Edges** -- Edges represent the relationship between the vertices in the graph. Edges may or may not have a value associated with them. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the edges would represent the path between cities.

### Applications of Graphs
Graphs are used everywhere, even in the fields of physics and chemistry.

A few other applications of graphs are:

- To visualize organized data.

- Directed Graphs are used in Google's Page Ranking Algorithm.

- Social Networks uses graphs to represent different users as vertices and edges to represent connections between them.

- In a mapping application, graphs are used to represent places and the path (distance) between them.

### Types of Graphs
There are many types of graphs, based on weights, direction, interconnectivity, and special properties. Let's look at the most common types of graphs.

- [Graphs Based on Direction](#based-on-direction)
- [Graphs Based on Weights](#based-on-weights)
- [Special Graphs](#special-graphs)

#### Based on Direction
##### Undirected Graphs
In an undirected graph, the edges have no path or direction. If there is a path from vertex X to vertex Y, then there is a path from vertex Y to vertex X. Edge (X, Y) represents the edge connecting vertex X to vertex Y.

That is, `edge (X, Y) == edge (Y, X)`.

##### Directed Graphs
In a directed graph or digraph, the edges have an orientation. If there is a path from vertex X to vertex Y, then there isn't necessarily a path from vertex Y to vertex X.

That is, `edge (X, Y) != edge (Y, X)`.

*Figure: Directed Graph ([Source](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-directed-and-undirected-graph/))*

#### Based on Weights
##### Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph has a value associated with every edge. The value may represent quantities like cost, distance, time, etc., depending on the graph. An edge of a weighted graph is represented as, `(u, v, w)`.

- `u` -> Source vertex
- `v` -> Destination vertex
- `w` -> Weight associated to go from u to v.

##### Unweighted Graphs
An unweighted graph does not have a value associated with every edge. An edge of an unweighted graph is represented as, `(u, v)`.

- `u` -> Source vertex
- `v` -> Destination vertex

![Unweighted Graphs](/engineering-education/graph-data-structure-python-part1/unweighted-graph.png)

*Figure:[Unweighted Graph](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Unweighted-Undirected-Graph_fig3_327864836)*

#### Special Graphs
##### Trees
An undirected graph with zero cycles is called a tree. A cycle in a graph is a sequence with the first and last vertices in the repeating sequence.

It has X vertices and X-1 edges.

*Figure:[Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))*

##### Rooted Tree
A rooted tree is a tree that has a designated root node. If edges point away from the root, it is called an **arborescence/out-tree**. If edges point towards the root, it is called an **anti-arborescence/in-tree**.

*Figure: Rooted Tree*

##### Directed Acyclic Graphs
Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs are graphs with no directed cycles. They represent structures with dependencies. It's also important to note that: All [arborescences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory)) are DAGs, but not all DAGs are arborescences.

*Figure:[Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)*

##### Complete Graphs
Complete graphs have a unique edge between every pair of vertices. A complete graph `n` vertices have `(n*(n-1)) / 2` edges and are represented by Kn.

### Representing Graphs
There are multiple ways of using data structures to represent a graph. The three most common ways are:

- [Adjacency Matrix](#adjacency-matrix)
- [Adjacency List](#adjacency-list)
- [Edge List](#edge-list)

#### Adjacency Matrix
An Adjacency Matrix is a very simple way to represent a graph. In a weighted graph, the element `**A[i][j]**` represents the cost of moving from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

In an unweighted graph, the element `**A[i][j]**` represents a Boolean value that determines if a path exists from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. If A[i][j] == 0, then no path from vertex i to vertex j exists. If A[i][j] == 1, there is a path from vertex i to vertex j.

##### Example:
```python
graph = [[0, 1, 2],
         [2, 0, 5],
         [4, 5, 0]]
```

The adjacency matrix above represents a graph that has 3 vertices. The cost of moving from vertex 0 to vertex 1 is 1, the cost of moving from vertex 0 to vertex 2 is 2, and so on. Usually, the cost of travelling from a vertex to itself is zero.

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix
| Advantages                                         | Disadvantages                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Space-efficient for dense graph representation.    | Space Complexity of this Data Structure - O(V^2). |
| The time complexity of getting an edge weight is O(1). | Iterating through the edges takes O(V^2) time.    |
| Simplest Graph Representation.                     |                                                   |


#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents a graph as a list that has vertex-edge mappings. Example, A â†’ [(B, 4), (C, 1)] represents an adjacency list where the vertex A is connected to B (weight 4) and C (weight 1). This works really well for sparse graphs.

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Adjacency List
| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Space-efficient for sparse graphs.     | Less space efficient for dense graphs.   |
| Iterating over the edges is efficient. | Edge weight lookup is O(E). (worse case) |
|                                        | Slightly more complex to represent.      |

#### Edge List
An edge list represents the graph as an unstructured list of edges.

#### Example:
```python
graph = [(C, A, 4), (A, C, 1), (B, C, 6),
         (A, B, 4), (C, B, 1), (C, D, 2)]
```

They are not widely used because this representation lacks structure.

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Edge List
| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Space-efficient for sparse graphs.     | Less space efficient for dense graphs.   |
| Iterating over the edges is efficient. | Edge weight lookup is O(E). (worse case) |
| Extremely simple representation.       | This representation lacks structure.     |
