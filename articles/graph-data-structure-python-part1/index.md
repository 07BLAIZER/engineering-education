Graphs are complex, non-linear data structures that are characterized by a group of vertices, connected by edges.

### Graphs: Introduction

Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of two major components:

- **Vertices** -- Vertices are entities in a graph. Every vertex has a value associated with it. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the vertices would represent cities.

- **Edges** -- Edges represent the relationship between the vertices in the graph. Edges may or may not have a value associated with them. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the edges would represent the distance between cities.

### Applications of Graphs

Graphs are used everywhere, even in the fields of physics and chemistry. A few applications of graphs are:

- Graphs are used to visualize data organization.

- Directed Graphs are used in Google's Page Ranking Algorithm.

- Social Networking uses graphs to represent different users as vertices and edges to represent connections between users.

- In a mapping application, graphs are used to represent places. They use shortest path algorithms to calculate the shortest distance between points on the map.

### Types of Graphs

There are many types of graphs, based on weights, direction, interconnectivity and special properties. Let us now look at the most common types of graphs.

- [Based on Direction](#based-on-direction)
- [Based on Weights](#based-on-weights)
- [Special Graphs](#special-graphs)

#### Based on Direction

##### Undirected Graphs

- In an undirected graph, the edges have no path or direction.

- If there is a path from vertex X to vertex Y, then there is a path from vertex Y to vertex X.

- edge (X, Y) represents the edge connecting vertex X to vertex Y.

- That is, `edge (X, Y) == edge (Y, X)`.

##### Directed Graphs

- In a directed graph or digraph, the edges have orientation.

- If there is a path from vertex X to vertex Y, then there necessarily need not exist a path from vertex Y to vertex X.

- That is, `edge (X, Y) != edge (Y, X)`.

#### Based on Weights

##### Weighted Graphs

- A weighted graph has a value associated with every edge.
- The value may represent quantities like cost, distance, time, etc.., depending on the graph.
- An edge of a weighted graph is represented as, `(u, v, w)`.
  - `u` -> Source vertex
  - `v` -> Destination vertex
  - `w` -> Weight associated to go from u to v.

##### Unweighted Graphs

- An unweighted graph does not have a value associated with every edge.
- An edge of an unweighted graph is represented as, `(u, v)`.
  - `u` -> Source vertex
  - `v` -> Destination vertex

#### Special Graphs

##### Trees

- An undirected graph with zero cycles is called a tree.

- A cycle in a graph is a sequence with the first and last vertices in the sequence repeating.

- It has X vertices and X-1 edges.

![Tree - Graphs](/engineering-education/graph-data-structure-python-part1/tree-graph.png)

*Figure: Tree ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)))*

##### Rooted Tree

- A rooted tree is a tree which has a designated root node.

- If edges point away from the root, it is called an **arborescence / out-tree**.

- If edges point towards the root, it is called an **anti-arborescence / in-tree**.

##### Directed Acyclic Graphs

- Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs are directed graphs with no cycles.

- They represent structures with dependencies.

- All arborescences are DAGs, but not all DAGs are arborescences.

##### Complete Graphs

- Complete graphs have a unique edge between every pair of vertices.

- A complete graph `n` vertices has `(n*(n-1)) / 2` edges and is represented by Kn.

### Representing Graphs

There are multiple ways of using data structures to represent a graph. The three most common ways are:

- [Adjacency Matrix](#adjacency-matrix)
- [Adjacency List](#adjacency-list)
- [Edge List](#edge-list)

#### Adjacency Matrix

- An Adjacency Matrix is a very simple way to represent a graph.

- The element `**A[i][j]**` represents the cost of moving from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

- Example,

```python
graph = [[0, 1, 2],
         [2, 0, 5],
         [4, 5, 0]]
```

- The above adjacency matrix represents a graph that has 3 vertices. The cost of moving from vertex 0 to vertex 1 is 1, the cost of moving from vertex 0 to vertex 2 is 2, and so on.

- Usually, the cost of travelling from a vertex to itself is zero.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix**

| Advantages                                         | Disadvantages                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Space efficient for dense graph representation.    | Space Complexity of this Data Structure - O(V^2). |
| Time complexity of getting an edge weight is O(1). | Iterating through the edges takes O(V^2) time.    |
| Simplest Graph Representation.                     |                                                   |

#### Adjacency List

- An adjacency list represents a graph as a list that has vertex-edge mappings.

- Example, A â†’ [(B, 4), (C, 1)] represents an adjacency list where the vertex A is connected to B (weight 4) and C (weight 1).

- This works really well for sparse graphs.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages of Adjacency List**

| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Space efficient for sparse graphs.     | Less space efficient for dense graphs.   |
| Iterating over the edges is efficient. | Edge weight lookup is O(E). (worse case) |
|                                        | Slightly more complex to represent.      |

#### Edge List

- An edge list represents the graph as an unstructures list of edges.

- Example,

```python
graph = [(C, A, 4), (A, C, 1), (B, C, 6),
         (A, B, 4), (C, B, 1), (C, D, 2)]
```

- Not widely used because this representation lacks structure.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages of Edge List**

| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Space efficient for sparse graphs.     | Less space efficient for dense graphs.   |
| Iterating over the edges is efficient. | Edge weight lookup is O(E). (worse case) |
| Extremely simple representation.       | This representation lacks structure.     |
