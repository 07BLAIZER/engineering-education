[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) Web Services (AWS) launched [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) in 2006, and since then, the service has undergone continuous improvement. This improvement includes additional storage classes to help enable secure object storage at a low cost for organizations of all sizes. With Amazon S3, organizations develop lifecycle policies for their objects and encrypt data at rest. They can also manage access controls by employing built-in security features, which include bucket policies and control lists.

### What is S3 Intelligent Tiering?

Amazon S3 is a storage infrastructure by Amazon Company offered to users to store their objects. Users also rely on Amazon S3 for data archival and backup and storage of data for analytics. Also, S3 is used to distribute [static content](https://blog.stackpath.com/static-content/#:~:text=Static%20content%20is%20any%20content,to%20transmit%20over%20the%20Internet.).

Amazon introduced an additional storage class, the S3 Intelligent Tiering, in 2018. Objects in this S3 Intelligent Tiering class are monitored for access patterns. These patterns act as a guide for the automatic placement of objects in the most economical storage class.

 Other Amazon S3 Storage Classes are: ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/))

- S3 Standard- acts as a general-purpose storage of frequently accessed (FA) data.
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) and S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) designed for long-lived and frequently accessed data.
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) designed for digital preservation, long-term archive.
- S3 Outposts storage class used to store S3 data on-premises.

With Amazon S3, users can manage their data throughout its lifecycle. The S3 Lifecycle Policy ensures automatic data transfer to different storage classes without any changes to the application. The usage of a combination of the S3 Lifecycle Policies, S3 Storage Class Analysis, and S3 Storage Classes enables users to save on storage costs without impacting performance or data availability.

Users of Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering make their data easily accessible across multiple availability zones. Thus, S3 Intelligent Tiering is perfect object storage option for organizations with changing data access patterns, unpredictable workloads, and those lacking experience optimizing and managing storage patterns.

### Why S3 Intelligent Tiering?

Amazon&#39;s S3 Intelligent Tiering is a cost-effective cloud storage option. It charges a fee to monitor and automate data movement between S3 tiers developed for infrequent access (IA) and frequent access (FA). S3 Intelligent Tiering moves objects not accessed for a specified time into the IA tier to save on storage costs. The objects are then moved back into the FA tier if accessed at a later point in time.

Companies that experience uncertainty in their data access frequency can leverage on S3 Intelligent Tiering for cost-saving. However, those with high confidence in their data access frequency may not find it their best storage class.

### Use Cases of S3 Intelligent Tiering

#### Unpredictable Workloads

Let&#39;s take the example of a company engaged in collecting and storing images. People access these images very frequently when newly uploaded. However, after some time, access to these images decreases. It is not surprising for months to go by without anyone accessing these images, and this is where Intelligence Tiering comes in. After 30 days without access, Intelligence Tiering moves the images to the IA tier. With this case, the company saves on costs. If the unpredictable happens in a particular geographical area, such as a hurricane, people&#39;s interest in those images rises again. Intelligent Tiering will monitor hurricane images since it is what users are interested in at the time. It will then automatically move images related to hurricanes back to the frequent access tier from the infrequent access tier to meet users&#39; demands for these images.

#### Changing Data Access Patterns

Organizations use Amazon S3 to build their [data lake](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/) architectures. These organizations employ hundreds of data scientists who use diverse applications. These scientists store objects in their companies&#39; data lakes daily. A scientist may store information and forget about it. In such a situation, S3 Intelligent Tiering helps to move objects, which are not accessed for 30 days, to the IA tier. This is beneficial to companies as they save money that they could have otherwise paid if the data was stored in the FA tier.

#### Managing Storage Patterns

Organizations that use Amazon Web Services to host their data understand their storage patterns better. They take insights from their Lifecycle Policies and S3 Storage Class Analysis to decide when to transfer information between different S3 storage classes. But companies inexperienced in cloud storage may incur expenses due to their inconsistency in addressing changes in data access needs. Thus, it is imperative to understand data storage patterns for you to benefit from low storage costs.

With Intelligent Tiering, you enjoy automated storage optimization. If you move data correctly between the FA and IA tiers guided by your needs, you will evade the charge for dormant data. Data stored in the FA tier attracts the same fees as data hosted in Standard S3 Storage. If you store data in the IA tier, you pay a lower storage charge in Infrequent and Archive storage. With the S3 Standard, you can transfer data between tiers at no extra cost, thus cutting on costs. Companies unable to understand their data access and usage patterns can better use this S3 Standard.

### Cost Optimization

The popularity of S3 Intelligent-Tiering is partly due to its ability to help organizations cut on their cloud storage costs. You will not pay any charges to retrieve data from S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage. Objects accessed in the IA tier move back to the FA tier automatically. You can move or retrieve objects between tiers at no data retrieval fees or additional tiering.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering has a simple pricing model, and you can predict the applicable fees more easily, unlike the previous offerings from Amazon Web Services.

Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering&#39;s six different storage costs allow users to address diverse storage requirements of their multiple data sets. But to lower your storage costs, you need to plan effectively and continually review your data access patterns. You have to select the right storage class on Amazon S3 to optimize your costs. But your choice is subject to your retrieval and access urgency requirements. You can implement further optimization using S3 Lifecycle policies.

### Conclusion

Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering optimizes your storage costs, letting you focus your attention and resources on designing databases and applications. Companies new to cloud computing and those with a better undemanding of access pattern optimization can leverage this technology for their data storage needs. This storage class ensures that organizations reduce their storage costs by ensuring data availability as they pay little for frequently accessed data.
