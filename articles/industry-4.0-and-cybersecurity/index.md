Many technologies have emerged in recent times. These technologies include the Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics and Cyber-Physical Systems. They have enabled new and impactful initiatives such as Industry 4.0. this initiative is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. Yet, the cybersecurity challenges associated with the technology have never been greater.

## Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 had been a concept of German origin as a government initiative.  Dubbed as the fourth industrial revolution, it was first introduced as Industrie 4.0 in 2011. The general goal was to improve competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. It was also to advance the new generation of smart manufacturing systems. Enabling technologies played a big part to support this goal. These technologies include:

***Internet of Things (IoT):** a network of interconnected objects. Objects are physical devices and are billions in number globally, through the internet. IIoT refers to Industrial Internet of Things.

***Cyber-Physical Systems:** integrations of physical processes with computation and networking processes. Key for automation and monitoring.

***Smart Factory:** advanced robotics, machine learning, additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping

***Cloud:** (Big Data Analytics) for storage as well as computation among others.

Depending on perspective, Industry 4.0 is a result of the Industrial Internet of Things. It is revolutionizing the manufacturing sector with innumerable benefits. Increase in efficiency, productivity, flexibility, agility are a few. Others include collaborative operation and sharing. The outcome includes lowering overhead, leading to increase profitability. Improved customer experience and facilitation of greater innovation and creativity is also noted.

## Fundamental Principles of Security

It is important to understand the Industry 4.0 cybersecurity landscape. We do this by first identifying the base principles of any security system. These outline the main objectives of information security.

### Confidentiality

This is sustaining the secrecy of the flow of information. In this context, throughout the manufacturing system value chains.

Industry 4.0 systems are complex yet flexible. This provides many points where attackers could intercept and tap information.

The damage caused by unauthorized access to information is costly. Imagine the interception of industrial industrial trade secrets. Confidentiality of the system must be upheld.

### Integrity

Integrity involves consistency, accuracy and reliability as well. This applies to the information coursing through the manufacturing system. There's an added focus on consistency, accuracy and reliability. This applies to the many physical components all through the supply chain.

### Availability

Physical attacks may render a manufacturing system out of service.

Cyber attacks have the same impact. By nature, well-interconnected Industry 4.0 architecture is a distributed system. This quality may mitigate attacks on system availability. Nonetheless, a coordinated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack may be crippling. Such an attack may disable a variety of supply chain components and the system halts as a result. This underpins the importance of backups and recovery. Resilience and robustness of Industry 4.0 systems is important.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Challenges and Implications

For all its advances, this revolution brings with it a myriad of challenges, in a security context. Threats and incidents are vast and prevalent.

Increased complexity of networks and systems signal more points of attack. Threat actors take advantage of these points. It also means there are more points to secure by enterprises. This proves to be a costly venture irrespective of the perspective taken.

### Denial of Service

The distributed nature of Industry 4.0 end to end networks subject them to risk of DDoS attacks.

### Enterprise Cyber-Espionage, Confidential Information and Intellectual Property

The incentive to commit Industry 4.0 espionage is at an all time high. Unlawful access to critical information

as well as access intellectual property is attractive to threat actors.

### Incidents and Attacks

Common threats on traditional Information Technology  systems include ransomware, malware, among others. These threats also affect Industry 4.0 systems.  This is due to the convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology. Which presents an opportunity for said threats to also damage physical systems. Besides these threats, the human element involved poses a danger in these systems.

A system may be secure and automated from end to end. Challenge may come in at a stage that requires human interaction. An employee at an enterprise may bring an industrial system to its knees. It can either be intentional or inadvertent. Furthermore, these technologies  are evolving at a rapid rate.  The threats and challenges evolve as well. Policies and frameworks to standardize these technologies struggle to keep up with challenges. As a result, policies and frameworks prove to be a challenge to devise.

Mitigation, response and combatting of threats is dependent on these policies and frameworks.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Approaches, Measures and Solutions

The discussed challenges and threats have the potential to cripple whole manufacturing processes. In turn, this impacts the rest of the supply chain. These challenges threaten the general potential of the technology. It jeopardizes technology implementation and impact. This is further evident when assessing the cost and risk associated . Hence, managing, solving and preventing some of these challenges has to be a priority. Enterprises and all key participants in Industry 4.0 need to be proactive. Below are a few potential solutions.

### Investment

Security is usually characterized by financial investment without return on investment. Especially considering a preventive approach in an organizational setting. Investing in a proactive approach is better than a reactive one. A reactive approach is whereby an enterprise is responding to a threat or challenge. This may turn out to be more expensive.

### Data security as a standard and solutions for massive heterogeneous data

Industry 4.0 systems, generate colossal heterogeneous data per given moment. Data management and storage may elevate the measure of vulnerability and risk. Organizing all this information requires the data to be secure first. There has to be a solid data security plan and there is an efficient solution to this challenge. Definition and development of secure data protocols is key. These protocols would allow interpretation, processing and organization of data .

### Standard security solutions

Use of simple, well-known solutions may reduce chances of breaches. This is applicable in specific use cases. As with standard IT systems, access authentication, access control and key management. A few most common information security measures come to mind. The use of  of application protection, anti-malware and antivirus are examples. One can track network usage, traffic and logs and put in place network segmentation. Security training of personnel is a valid solution

Patching systems is also an option. This may prove useful to ensure industrial systems are up to date and secure. Additionally, regular system audits and frequent penetration testing are worthy measures.

### Industry 4.0 security policy and strategy

Policy and strategy are key tools in the fight to actualize Industry 4.0's full potential. These are measures undertaken to ensure the security of Industry 4.0 organizations. They include reaction and response to cyber-attacks and cyber threats. Standardization across various Industry 4.0 stakeholders will allow for homogeneous response strategies. This also births a unanimous mindset towards an effective architecture and implementation.

### Research efforts

The integration of these emerging technologies has brought rapid changes to industries. The changes have brought about huge technological, social and economic impact. This means that we need more extensive research. Research can drive development of improved system architectures. It may help uphold transparency and trust through the value chain. This should be achieved without compromising the principles of security.

## Final Note

Industry 4.0 has the potential to be  he undisputed fourth industrial revolution. Yet, there is some way to go before it lives up to its full potential and application. Management or solving of the discussed challenges is key to the longevity of Industry 4.0. We should not underestimate the need for further research. It would go a long way to understand how to design  Industry 4.0 infrastructure. Research would also boost efforts to execute, secure and deploy effective infrastructure.
