Industrial revolutions describe transitional periods that welcome new manufacturing procedures. The first three industrial revolutions can be described as mechanization to improve manufacturing process, introduction of electricity in manufacturing and the digital revolution in manufacturing process respectively. These revolutions have evolved business practices in their respective times. The ever-changing technological landscape of our current time has given rise to impactful technologies that have edged us closer to the fourth industrial revolution. These technologies include the Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics and Cyber-Physical Systems. The fourth revolution, like its predecessors, is evolving business practices in the manufacturing industry. New business models and services are emerging. The nature of manufacturing products has changed. Manufacturing systems are becoming not only fully autonomous but also ever-increasingly intelligent. Supply chains are becoming more flexible. Products are more flexible and precise as per requirements of the consumer. However, the cybersecurity challenges associated with the fourth industrial revolution have never been greater. Breaches may lead to lower quality or quantity of production. Brand reputation may be impacted. Environmental and equipment damage may be caused. Hefty financial and legal consequences may arise. Trade secrets may be lost through breaches. Industry 4.0 cybersecurity cannot be ignored.

## Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 had been a concept of German origin as a government initiative.  Dubbed as the fourth industrial revolution, it was first introduced as Industrie 4.0 in 2011. The general goal was to improve competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. It was also to advance the new generation of smart manufacturing systems. 

But what does it do differently from the previous industrial revolution? Let us briefly glance at the third industrial revolution, which was known as the digital revolution. Computerization was the key aim of this period in industrial history since digital systems replaced mechanical and analog ones. This naturally came after electrification of the manufacturing floor. The use of computer systems in the manufacturing industry started with recordkeeping systems as well as accounting systems. 

The digital revolution, also known as the information age is dated between 1950 and 1970 and it has to be appreciated that it was a result of strides in computers and communication technology and has arguably advanced to include automation and communications since the 1970s. However, there have been no disruptive leaps forward in an industrial level since then. Rather, progress had been at the consumer level, with the ubiquity of mobile devices and emergence of e-commerce.

With the above introduction to the third industrial revolution which attained automation using computer systems, comparing industry 4.0 to the third industrial revolution it can be distinguished that in the fourth and current industrial revolution, the focus of design principles is on connectivity and interconnection, information transparency, decentralization among others. 

Therefore, Industry 4.0 as an initiative can be described as a new paradigm that uses various technologies to create production systems of the future. This system is meant to be automated, integrated, flexible and highly customizable. We refer to these technologies as enabling technologies. They include; Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems, Smart Factory and the Cloud. We can also argue that interoperability is a key enabler of Industry 4.0 since these technologies collaborate and are integrated. There are more enabling technologies but we shall only delve into the four later on. 



***Internet of Things (IoT):** a network of interconnected objects. Objects are physical devices and are billions in number globally, through the internet. IIoT refers to Industrial Internet of Things.

***Cyber-Physical Systems:** integrations of physical processes with computation and networking processes. Key for automation and monitoring.

***Smart Factory:** advanced robotics, machine learning, additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping

***Cloud:** (Big Data Analytics) for storage as well as computation among others.

Depending on perspective, Industry 4.0 is a result of the Industrial Internet of Things. It is revolutionizing the manufacturing sector with innumerable benefits. Increase in efficiency, productivity, flexibility, agility are a few. Others include collaborative operation and sharing. The outcome includes lowering overhead, leading to increase profitability. Improved customer experience and facilitation of greater innovation and creativity is also noted.



### Why should you care about Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity?

Before the advent of Industry 4.0, the goal of cybersecurity involved defending organizational parameters. It very commonly involved protecting a private computer network. The methods used to prevent breaches include use of firewalls, anti-malware software, intrusion detection systems among others. Even so, this approach to cybersecurity is becoming more obsolete by the day especially in an industrial context. Industry 4.0 aims to blur the boundaries between the digital and the physical worlds. 
From the perspective of a practitioner (a manager, engineer, cybersecurity expert) in an evolving manufacturing industry, it is worth noting that the integrated and distributed nature of Industry 4.0 makes it impossible to completely secure a business from cyber-threats due to a number of reasons:

1.	**Data sharing.** With Industry 4.0, sharing of data and intellectual property is done across supply chains and various stakeholders. Systems are being integrated between consumers and suppliers. Data is distributed all through the systems, which means a greater security scope.  

2.	**Points of attack.** Since these systems involve a number of stakeholders in the value chain as well as consumers, the number of user access points drastically increases. These access points are possible points of attack. The more points of attack to cover, the harder (and more expensive) it becomes to secure the whole system.

3.	**Convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology.** Software and hardware boundaries are blurred. To secure these Industry 4.0 systems from end to end, it is important to consider the digital components as well as the physical ones. The methods previously used such as anti-malware, intrusion detection systems and firewalls may fall short of the mark when involving software and different types of hardware systems.

4.	**Playing catch-up.** Even prior to Industry 4.0, cybersecurity threats tended to be one step ahead of potential solutions or preventive measures. It is common to set up preventive measures in a private network such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems then react to new threats that bypass such measures. However, with Industry 4.0, given the systems cut across industries and have possibly thousands of different devices and networks interacting with each other, the types of threats to anticipate increase. The possibility of new threats increases exponentially. For example, emerging threats may target a specific device among thousands in a network. This is incredibly difficult to anticipate.     

Furthermore, in the event breaches occur, they have costly implications which are discussed below.

### Consequences of breaches

#### Financial cost and damage 

Due to prevalence of cyber threats in Industrial Control Systems, proactive Cybersecurity actions are taken by stakeholders and enterprises across the supply chain. This means that Cybersecurity has increased priority among various industries, particularly those implementing Industry 4.0.

A financial cost is attached to this prioritization and proactivity. Risk assessment, identifying of ever changing and growing threat landscape as well as placement of measures to prevent and mitigate is increasingly costly to enterprises, considering in a proactive approach, threats might not translate into a reality. 

Alternatively, a reactive approach may be more costly since critical information may be compromised, corrupted or ultimately destroyed. For example, consider a ransomware attack, where enterprises and users are at the mercy of attackers. Attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems may lead to physical damage of critical equipment. Peersonnel may end up getting hurt through machine malfunction failure or explosions. The physical environment around these systems may be impacted, for example in the case of a fire. Tarnished reputations may lead to reduction of profits and lawsuits may be birthed as a result of attacks on grounds on failure to protect data or recover from breaches. Furthermore, incident response may be expensive depending on urgency and severity of the attack.

The financial aspect of preventing, mitigating and responding to attacks cannot be ignored in todayâ€™s Industry 4.0 world.










## Fundamental Principles of Security

It is important to understand the Industry 4.0 cybersecurity landscape. We do this by first identifying the base principles of any security system. These outline the main objectives of information security.

### Confidentiality

This is sustaining the secrecy of the flow of information. In this context, throughout the manufacturing system value chains.

Industry 4.0 systems are complex yet flexible. This provides many points where attackers could intercept and tap information.

The damage caused by unauthorized access to information is costly. Imagine the interception of industrial industrial trade secrets. Confidentiality of the system must be upheld.

### Integrity

Integrity involves consistency, accuracy and reliability as well. This applies to the information coursing through the manufacturing system. There's an added focus on consistency, accuracy and reliability. This applies to the many physical components all through the supply chain.

### Availability

Physical attacks may render a manufacturing system out of service.

Cyber attacks have the same impact. By nature, well-interconnected Industry 4.0 architecture is a distributed system. This quality may mitigate attacks on system availability. Nonetheless, a coordinated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack may be crippling. Such an attack may disable a variety of supply chain components and the system halts as a result. This underpins the importance of backups and recovery. Resilience and robustness of Industry 4.0 systems is important.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Challenges and Implications

For all its advances, this revolution brings with it a myriad of challenges, in a security context. Threats and incidents are vast and prevalent.

Increased complexity of networks and systems signal more points of attack. Threat actors take advantage of these points. It also means there are more points to secure by enterprises. This proves to be a costly venture irrespective of the perspective taken.

### Denial of Service

The distributed nature of Industry 4.0 end to end networks subject them to risk of DDoS attacks.

### Enterprise Cyber-Espionage, Confidential Information and Intellectual Property

The incentive to commit Industry 4.0 espionage is at an all time high. Unlawful access to critical information

as well as access intellectual property is attractive to threat actors.

### Incidents and Attacks

Common threats on traditional Information Technology  systems include ransomware, malware, among others. These threats also affect Industry 4.0 systems.  This is due to the convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology. Which presents an opportunity for said threats to also damage physical systems. Besides these threats, the human element involved poses a danger in these systems.

A system may be secure and automated from end to end. Challenge may come in at a stage that requires human interaction. An employee at an enterprise may bring an industrial system to its knees. It can either be intentional or inadvertent. Furthermore, these technologies  are evolving at a rapid rate.  The threats and challenges evolve as well. Policies and frameworks to standardize these technologies struggle to keep up with challenges. As a result, policies and frameworks prove to be a challenge to devise.

Mitigation, response and combatting of threats is dependent on these policies and frameworks.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Approaches, Measures and Solutions

The discussed challenges and threats have the potential to cripple whole manufacturing processes. In turn, this impacts the rest of the supply chain. These challenges threaten the general potential of the technology. It jeopardizes technology implementation and impact. This is further evident when assessing the cost and risk associated . Hence, managing, solving and preventing some of these challenges has to be a priority. Enterprises and all key participants in Industry 4.0 need to be proactive. Below are a few potential solutions.

### Investment

Security is usually characterized by financial investment without return on investment. Especially considering a preventive approach in an organizational setting. Investing in a proactive approach is better than a reactive one. A reactive approach is whereby an enterprise is responding to a threat or challenge. This may turn out to be more expensive.

### Data security as a standard and solutions for massive heterogeneous data

Industry 4.0 systems, generate colossal heterogeneous data per given moment. Data management and storage may elevate the measure of vulnerability and risk. Organizing all this information requires the data to be secure first. There has to be a solid data security plan and there is an efficient solution to this challenge. Definition and development of secure data protocols is key. These protocols would allow interpretation, processing and organization of data .

### Standard security solutions

Use of simple, well-known solutions may reduce chances of breaches. This is applicable in specific use cases. As with standard IT systems, access authentication, access control and key management. A few most common information security measures come to mind. The use of  of application protection, anti-malware and antivirus are examples. One can track network usage, traffic and logs and put in place network segmentation. Security training of personnel is a valid solution

Patching systems is also an option. This may prove useful to ensure industrial systems are up to date and secure. Additionally, regular system audits and frequent penetration testing are worthy measures.

### Industry 4.0 security policy and strategy

Policy and strategy are key tools in the fight to actualize Industry 4.0's full potential. These are measures undertaken to ensure the security of Industry 4.0 organizations. They include reaction and response to cyber-attacks and cyber threats. Standardization across various Industry 4.0 stakeholders will allow for homogeneous response strategies. This also births a unanimous mindset towards an effective architecture and implementation.

### Research efforts

The integration of these emerging technologies has brought rapid changes to industries. The changes have brought about huge technological, social and economic impact. This means that we need more extensive research. Research can drive development of improved system architectures. It may help uphold transparency and trust through the value chain. This should be achieved without compromising the principles of security.

## Final Note

Industry 4.0 has the potential to be  he undisputed fourth industrial revolution. Yet, there is some way to go before it lives up to its full potential and application. Management or solving of the discussed challenges is key to the longevity of Industry 4.0. We should not underestimate the need for further research. It would go a long way to understand how to design  Industry 4.0 infrastructure. Research would also boost efforts to execute, secure and deploy effective infrastructure.
