![hero](/engineering-education/industry-4.0-and-cybersecurity/hero.jpg)

A number of technologies have emerged in recent times. These technologies such as the Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data Analytics and Smart Factory have enabled new and impactful initiatives such as Industry 4.0. Although Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry, the cybersecurity challenges have never been greater.
This article briefly discusses Industry 4.0 through the enabling technologies. Security is also given an overview in terms of the fundamental principles. The cybersecurity challenges, threats and insinuations are discussed as are the current and proposed measures and solutions. It is also inferred that there are numerous security challenges that have to be addressed before Industry 4.0 can achieve its full potential and impact.

## Industry 4.0

First publicly introduced as Industrie 4.0 in 2011, industry 4.0 had been a concept of German origin to improve competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. Originally it had been a German government initiative and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution with a key aim to advance the new generation of smart manufacturing systems, heavily incorporating enabling technologies. These technologies include:
***Internet of Things (IoT):** a network of interconnected objects, that are physical devices and are billions in number globally, through the internet. IIoT refers to Industrial Internet of Things.
***Cyber-Physical Systems:** integrations of physical processes with computation and networking processes, to be used for automation and monitoring.
***Smart Factory:** notably advanced robotics, machine learning, additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping
***Cloud:** (Big Data Analytics) for storage as well as computation among others.

Industry 4.0 is arguably a result of the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things to be more precise, and is revolutionizing the manufacturing sector with innumerable benefits such as increase in efficiency, productivity, flexibility, agility, collaborative operation and sharing, which in turn lower overhead, increase profitability, improve customer experience and facilitates greater innovation and creativity.

## Fundamental Principles of Security

In order to understand the cybersecurity landscape of Industry 4.0, it is necessary to identify the fundamental principles of any security system. These outline the main objectives of information security.

### Confidentiality

This is sustaining the secrecy of the flow of information throughout the manufacturing system value chains (both vertical and horizontal). Due to the flexible nature of Industry 4.0 and the complexities involved, there are many points where information could be intercepted and tapped by attackers. The damage caused by unauthorized access to information, such as industrial trade secrets, is costly in an industrial environment. Confidentiality of the system must be upheld.

### Integrity

From an Industry 4.0 perspective, the integrity involves consistency, accuracy and reliability as well. This applies to the information coursing through the manufacturing system but also an added focus on consistency, accuracy and reliability of the numerous physical components all through the supply chain

### Availability

A manufacturing system may be out of service due to a variety of physical attacks as well as cyber-attacks. Although, the distributed nature of well-interconnected Industry 4.0 architecture may mitigate attacks on system availability. Regardless of the distributed nature, a coordinated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack may simultaneously disable a variety of supply chain components. The system halts as a result of such an attack. This underpins the importance of backups and recovery as well as resilience and robustness of Industry 4.0 systems.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Challenges and Implications

Regardless, this revolution brings with it a myriad of challenges, in a security context. Threats and incidents are vast and prevalent.
Increased complexity of networks and systems signal more points of attack for threat actors and more points to secure by enterprises. This ultimately proves to be a costly endeavor irrespective of the perspective taken.

### Denial of Service

The distributed nature of Industry 4.0 end to end networks subject them to risk of Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

### Enterprise Cyber-Espionage, Confidential Information and Intellectual Property

There is, more than ever, increased incentive to commit Industry 4.0 espionage and access critical information as well as unlawfully access and obtain intellectual property.

### Incidents and Attacks

Most of the threats usual threats on traditional Information Technology systems now affect Industry 4.0 systems as well since the convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology presents an opportunity for said threats to also damage physical systems. Threats such as ransomware, malware, viruses are present in these industrial systems. In addition to these threats, the human element involved poses a danger in these systems.
A system may be secure and automated from end to end, save for a single point or stage that requires human interaction. An employee at an enterprise may inadvertently or intentionally bring an industrial system to its knees. Furthermore, since these technologies (as well as the threats and challenges) are evolving at a rapid rate, policies and frameworks to standardize these technologies and mitigate, respond and combat threats prove to be a challenge to formulate.

## Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Approaches, Measures and Solutions

The challenges increasingly emanating from IIoT and Industry 4.0 have the potential to cripple whole manufacturing processes hence impact the rest of the supply chain as well. Furthermore, they threaten the overall potential of the technology in terms of implementation, impact and notable value as compared to the cost and risk associated. Hence managing, solving and preventing some of these challenges has to be a priority to enterprises and all key participants in Industry 4.0. A few methods are highlighted below.

### Investment

Security is usually characterized by financial investment without return on investment while in an organizational setting. Especially considering a preventive approach. Although, it can be argued that investing in a proactive approach is better than a reactive one, whereby an enterprise is responding to a threat or challenge that may turn out to be more expensive.

### Data security as a standard and solutions for massive heterogeneous data

Industry 4.0 systems in this context, generate colossal heterogeneous data per given moment. Data management and storage may elevate the measure of vulnerability and risk. Organizing and dealing with all this information requires the data to be secure first. A solid data security plan is required. An efficient solution to this challenge would be definition, development and provision of secure protocols that would allow data to be interpreted, processed and organized efficiently.

### Standard security solutions

Simple and well-known solutions may be used to reduce chances of breaches in specific use cases. As with standard IT systems, access authentication, access control and key management.
The most commonly implemented technology measures include use of application protection, anti-malware and antivirus. Monitoring of network usage, traffic and logs, network segmentation may be implemented. Security training of personnel is a valid solution
Patching systems may also prove fairly useful to ensure industrial systems are up to date and secure. Regular system audits, frequent penetration testing should be considered.

### Industry 4.0 security policy and strategy

The policies in this context refer to a framework of measures undertaken to ensure the security of Industry 4.0 organizations, including reaction and response to cyber-attacks and cyber threats. Standardization across various Industry 4.0 stakeholders will allow for homogeneous response strategies and a unanimous mindset towards an effective architecture and implementation

### Research efforts

The integration of these emerging technologies and the rapid changes they are bringing to industries, not only Industry 4.0 but to the whole technological landscape as well as the social and economic impact they bring with them mean that more extensive research needs to be done to, say, improve system architectures, upholding transparency and trust through the value chain without compromising the principles of security among others.

## Final Note

For Industry 4.0 to write itself into the books of history as the undisputed fourth industrial revolution and live up to its full potential and application, the aforementioned challenges need to be managed or completely solved. Further research needs to be done to understand how to more effectively, design, implement, secure and deploy effective Industry 4.0 infrastructure.
