### Introduction
Scrum is an agile framework for developing products. The framework is mostly used for software development. Scrum has been in use since the early 1990s. It is a flexible and holistic approach to project management.  Scrum focus on continuous improvement,  learning, and adjustment to the changing market, user requirements, and technology. Typically, Scrum has a small team made of a highly adaptive and flexible individual. Agile is an iterative approach to project management. Agile helps a team deliver a product to the customer faster, in different iterations. Customer feedback is critical in every iteration. There are several agile frameworks, such as Kanban and Scrum. The article will cover:
- [Introduction to Scrum](#Scrum-Overview)
- [Scrum Roles](#Scrum-Team)
- [Scrum Events](#Scrum-Events)
- [Scrum Artifacts](#Scrum-Artifacts)
- [Why Use Scrum?](#Why-Use-Scrum?)

### Scrum Overview
Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand, but challenging to master. Scrum involves a set of events, tools, and roles that work together to help teams structure and manage a project.

It is used in different fields, including marketing, manufacturing, and software development. In this article, we will use examples in software development. In software development, requirements, market, development, and other external factors change. Scrum embraces the changes as a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints. Big projects are broken into small pieces that are delivered in several sprints making the project more manageable. Risk and cost are also reduced, as it is easier to identify risks in the early development stages. Every Sprint is released to users, and feedback is collected. Speed to market is also increased. Scrum is all about continuous learning and adapting to changes. The team does not know everything about the project. Therefore, adaptation to changes is critical.

### Scrum Team
There are three different roles in Scrum, namely:
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- The Development Team

The team is cross-functional and self-organizing. The team decides how best to accomplish the work and has all the skills required to deliver it.

#### The Product Owner
The product owner plays in the part of a client or stakeholder. He/She is one person and not a group of people. He or she is responsible for managing the product backlog by clearly expressing items. They ensure that the product backlog items are clear for the development team.

#### The Development Team
It is a team with the necessary skills to create a product increment by itself. That is why it is said to cross-functional and self-organizing. Members lay multiple roles such as design, business analysis, operations, programming, and testing. Thus, the team recognizes no title for its members. Team members may have some particular competencies and areas of specialization, but they are accountable as one. The team size ranges from three to nine members.

### The Scrum Master
The scrum master is a servant leader responsible for protecting the team and the process. The scrum master helps everyone understands the Scrum framework as defined in the [Scrum guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). Other roles include:

- Ensuring a good working relationship between the Development Team and the product owner
- Protect the team from outside interactions and disruptions
- Facilitate Scrum events
- Providing optimal techniques for optimal product backlog management
- Removing any obstacle that may affect the development team progress

### Scrum Events
There are five different formal meetings or events in the Scrum. Each event is time-bound to a maximum duration. Strict Scrum events reduce the need for having meetings not defined in the scrum framework. The events are created to foster transparency and inspection within the Scrum Team.

#### The Sprint
Sprint is the backbone of Scrum. It takes 1 to 4 weeks. During this period, a potentially shippable product increment is created. A list of product backlog items, selected during sprint planning, are worked on during each Sprint. A new Sprint starts immediately after the end of the previous one. If a sprint took more than a month, the definition or market of what is being developed might change, increasing complexity and risk. Each successful Sprint constitutes an increment in the final product. Can a sprint be canceled? Yes, a sprint can only be canceled by the product owner. In such a scenario, completed and "done" product backlog items are reviewed. Incomplete items are re-estimated and put back on the product backlog. Cancellation of a sprint is rare and should be avoided. Sprint cancellations are traumatic to the scrum team.

#### Sprint Planning
The development team, product owner, and scrum master discuss the items to be worked on during the Sprint. The scrum team creates a sprint goal. Top priority product backlog items to be worked on during the spring are selected. The primary purpose of the Sprint planning is to address "What can be done during the upcoming sprint?" and "How will work needed to deliver the increment will be done." Sprint planning takes a maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint.

#### Daily Scrum
It is a 15 minute Stand up meeting for the development team held daily at the same place and time. The team discuss what they have completed in the last 24 hours and plan for the next 24 hours work. Check on the progress towards the sprint goals is also done in the stand-up meeting.

#### Sprint Review
It is held at the end of the print to review the increment. The team demonstrates the completed work to the product owner and the key stakeholders. It is meant to get feedback and encourage collaboration. It takes at most four hours for a one-month Sprint. The Development team discuss what went well during the Sprint, the challenges encountered, and how they were addressed. They also discuss how they will improve the process in the future. Sprint review provides important input to the upcoming Sprint planning. The deliverable of the Sprint Review is an updated product backlog items for the coming Sprint.

#### Sprint Retrospective
Sprint Retrospective takes place before the next sprint planning. It takes at most three hours for a three months Sprint. The scrum team discusses the following:

- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What will the team commit in the next Sprint?

Scrum team members make actionable commitments. The deliverables of this meeting are improvements to be implemented in the next spring by the scrum team.

### Scrum Artifacts
In Scrum, artifacts are there to ensure and maximize the transparency of information. Every team member must have the same understanding of an artifact.

#### Product Backlog
The product backlog consists of a list of known features, functions, enhancements, and fixes needed. It is the only source of requirements for the Scrum team. The product owner is responsible for its content, availability, and ordering. Since the requirement never stops changing, so does the product backlog. All the requirements are broken down from user requirements with the most prioritized at the top.

#### Sprint Backlog
The current sprint backlog items are selected from high priority features in the product backlog. It is the output of the sprint planning event. The sprint backlog is modified throughout the Sprint. Burndown charts are used to monitor sprint progress. A burndown chart shows the relationship between work left to do and time. See the diagram below.

#### Increment
The sum of all product backlog completed and "done" during a Sprint is referred to as an increment. Each Scrum Team has a definition of "done." "Done" means in a usable condition as per the Scrum team definition.

### Why Use Scrum?
There are many reasons why we should use Scrum:

- Faster release of usable products to the users and customers. After every increment, the customer can have an early release of the product. This is unlike in the traditional [waterfall approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). The product is shipped to the customer after the last stage of development in Waterfall.
- Scrum saves time and cost: With reduced meetings and small manageable teams, Scrum reduces cost and time.
- Scrum encourages teamwork: There is a sense of responsibility in the self-organizing team. Collaboration and daily stand up meetings give every member a chance to have their ideas addressed.
- It is easy to learn and use: As discussed, there are only three roles in the framework, thus easy to learn and use.

### Conclusion
Scrum framework rules, artifacts, roles, and events are easy to understand. Each successful Sprint makes the team motivated and keeps the user happy as the progress is seen in short durations. Scrum is indeed an excellent agile project management framework for any organization. However, it takes time to master Scrum, but long-term benefits outweigh the learning curve. Online collaboration tools to help you master scrum faster are also available.
