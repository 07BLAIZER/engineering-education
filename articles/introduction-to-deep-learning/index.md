Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning(ML), DL learns features and tasks directly from data such as images, text, or sound.

To take it further, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence(AI). AI is the capability of machines and computers to mimic human intelligence and behavior.

AI is accomplished by studying how the human brain operates while trying to solve a problem. ML is a branch of AI that gives machines and computers the ability to learn data without being programmed.

Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that automatically extracts the useful pieces of information or makes decisions using neural networks. Deep Learning is more than a set of tools to solve practical problems. DL was made to imitate how the human brain works while making decisions.

Neural Networks design depends on the composition of the brainpower. Neural Networks are trained to learn models, identify patterns, and arrange non-identical kinds of information as the human brain does.

Deep Learning algorithms strive to reason the same as humans by studying data with a particular [logical framework](https://medium.com/tebs-lab/introduction-to-deep-learning-a46e92cb0022).

### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
Deep Learning and machine learning are both types of AI that classify data and train models.

1. Data presentation in the system. Machine Learning algorithms need structured data to solve data problems. Deep Learning relies on layers of Neural Networks.
Example: you have several animal images, such as birds and pets. A person would label each image to help an ML algorithm differentiate the images. Deep Learning is a bit complex. This is because using the same dataset. Deep Learning algorithms toil to evaluate variations between categories and classify them.

2. A Machine Learning algorithm can take a minute or up to a few hours to finish execution. Deep Learning algorithms can go up to weeks to halt the execution. This is due to the complexity of Neural Networks. Neural networks need a large number of weights and more parameters.

3. The performance of ML algorithms is better when the dataset is small or medium. Deep Learning algorithms fail to perform well on such datasets. DL algorithms instead perform exceptionally well for bigger datasets.

4.	Machine Learning algorithms can perform on inexpensive. Deep Learning is a potent tool. It performs well on a powerful machine equipped with multiple GPUs, thus [providing high performance](https://hackr.io/blog/machine-learning-vs-deep-learning).

5. Machine Learning algorithms study and understand labeled data in a dataset. Deep Learning algorithms require no human intervention. This is because layers in Neural Networks place data in different concepts. Neural Networks also enable DL algorithms to learn independently.

6. Deep Learning is an essential part of Machine Learning. It provides solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and NLP. Deep Learning performs well with images, text, sound recognition as compared to Machine Learning.

### How Deep Learning Works
The functioning of the brain influences deep Learning algorithms. Neural Networks are made up of layers and nodes, as well as the brain comprises of neurons.

Neural Networks consist of:
- Input layer
- Hidden layers
- Output layer

The input layer receives input data. Hidden layers perform mathematical computations on the information. The output layer gives the result. The problem is solved based on computation from the distributive [weights of all layers](https://www.modev.com/blog/how-deep-learning-works).

A good example to use is the recognition of a house image. The first layer might focus on borderlines. Another layer focus on the object colors, and another the measurements of the image.

Deep Learning systems need a powerful software. This is because they process huge amounts of data and complex computations.

### Why we need Deep Learning
Deep Learning is revolutionizing so many fields to solve data problems.
Deep Learning is an excellent and powerful tool. It helps many organizations and developers create exciting AI applications.
Think of successful surgeries, causing little or no deaths due to surgical errors. Think of a world with no accident due to smart cars. In several years to come, the world will be on another level due to Deep Learning.

### Applications of Deep Learning
There is massive excitement about artificial intelligence and its subsets. Here are Deep Learning applications that will govern the world.

1. Self-driven cars

Companies such as Google are building driver assistance services. Also, they are teaching computers how to use digital sensors instead of human sensors.

2. Natural Language Processing

Machines are taught to understand complexities associated with languages such as semantics. To achieve this, [NLP through Deep Learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/natural-language-processing-tutorial/) plays a significant role. NLP also catch linguistic nuances and frame appropriate responses.

3. Healthcare

Deep Learning is completely revolutionizing the healthcare and the medical industries. According to [Medium](https://medium.com/breathe-publication/top-15-deep-learning-applications-that-will-rule-the-world-in-2018-and-beyond-7c6130c43b01), AI has enabled healthcare and medical industries to advance tremendously.
Clinical researchers use DL to find a cure for untreatable diseases. DL helps with a speedy diagnostic of dangerous conditions. Many cancer tests, such as the Pap test and Mammograms, use DL to examine cells image using a microscope.

4. Virtual Assistants

Siri and Google Assistants are approved deep learning virtual assistants. Deep Learning enables virtual assistants to learn and understand commands given by a user. Virtual assistants then execute by providing the appropriate answer naturally. Virtual assistants use Deep Learning to learn about you, from what you search most.

5. Fraud Detection

Banking and financial sectors are benefiting from Deep Learning to detect transaction fraud. [Autoencoders](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/deep-learning-applications/) in Tensorflow are being used to catch credit card fraud, thus saving a lot of money from fraudsters. Fraud prevention is done based on recognizing patterns in customer transactions.

6. Image Recognition

Image Recognition using Deep Learning aims to recognize and learn content in images. Also, Deep Learning aims to understand their surrounding. Image Recognition is mostly used in gaming and social media.

7. Entertainment

Entertainment industries such as [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ke-en/) recommends to their viewers what they need. Deep Learning enables the entertainment industry to understand the consumer's behavior. This helps to provide an exciting experience to clients. Deep Learning is revolutionizing the filmmaking process. Cameras can learn body language and conduct voice synthesis. Deep Learning also helps to emulate someone's voice to imbibe in virtual characters.

### Working of Neural Networks
Neural Networks are algorithms modeled to function like the human brain. Neural Networks is a system of hardware and software patterned after neurons operation in the human mind. Neurons are decision-makers.

Neural Networks comprise of the input layer, hidden layers, and the output layer.

The input layer is where the neural network acquires data in numeral values between 0 and 1. Any data can be represented as a number, whether it is words, sound, or image. Each input neuron represents a single feature.

When the neurons have data, it is redirected to other neurons in the next layer (hidden layer). There are many hidden layers. Every hidden layer numerically combines all the figures it receives.

The major goal is measuring whether the inputted data has various components. Each neuron then sends data to neurons in the output layer.

The output layer predicts the outcome. Neural Networks work with numbers. Math is the key to Neural Networks, Artificial intelligence, and its techniques; [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
