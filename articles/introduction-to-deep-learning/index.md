Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that learns features and tasks directly from data such as image, text, or sound. On the other hand, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. AI is the capability of machines and computers to mimic human intelligence and behaviour. AI is accomplished by studying how the human brain thinks, learns, and works while trying to solve a problem. ML is a branch of AI that gives machines and computers the ability to learn data without being programmed.

Deep Learning is a Machine Learning technique that automatically extracts the useful pieces of information or makes decisions using neural networks. Deep Learning is more than a set of tools to solve practical problems, and it is implemented with the help of Neural Networks. DL imitates how the human brain works to make decisions. Neural Networks are designed based on the structure of the human brain. Neural networks are trained to learn models, identify patterns, and classify different types of information, just like the human brain.

Deep Learning algorithms attempt to develop the same conclusions as humans by analyzing data with a given [logical structure](https://medium.com/tebs-lab/introduction-to-deep-learning-a46e92cb0022).

### Machine Learning VS Deep Learning

Deep Learning and machine learning are both types of AI that classify data and train models.

1. Data presentation in the system. Machine learning algorithms require structured data, while deep learning relies on layers of neural networks. For example, you have several animal images, such as birds and pets. A person would label each image to help a Machine Learning algorithm difference the pictures. Deep learning is a bit complex. This is because using the same dataset. Deep Learning algorithms work to figure out the differences between the two categories and group them.
2. A Machine learning algorithm takes a minute to a few hours to finish execution. On the other hand, Deep learning algorithms go up to weeks to halt the execution. This is due to the complexity of neural networks requiring a large number of weights and more parameters.
3. The performance of Machine Learning Algorithms is useful when the dataset is small or medium. Deep Learning algorithms fail to perform well on such datasets. DL algorithms instead perform exceptionally well for bigger datasets.
4. Machine Learning algorithms can perform on low-end machines. On the other hand, Deep Learning is a potent tool. It performs well on a powerful machine. The machine is equipped with multiple GPUs thus [providing high performance](https://hackr.io/blog/machine-learning-vs-deep-learning).
5. Machine Learning algorithms are trained to study and understand labelled data in a dataset. In contrast, Deep Learning algorithms require no human intervention. This is because layers in neural networks place data in different concepts. Neural networks also enable DL algorithms to learn independently.
6. Through Virtual Assistant solutions, machine learning, and deep learning automate tasks on applications.
7. Deep Learning has become a vital part of machine learning. It provides the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and NLP. Deep Learning performs well with images, text, sound recognition compared to machine learning.

### How Deep Learning work

Deep Learning algorithms are inspired by how the brain functions. Deep Learning is achieved with the help of neural networks. Neural networks are made up of layers and nodes, like the brain is made up of neurons.

Neural networks consist of the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. There are many hidden layers that perform mathematical computations on the information. The output layer gives the result. It identifies the object based on calculation from the collective [weights of all layers](https://www.modev.com/blog/how-deep-learning-works).
A good example is you have a house image to identify. The first layer might focus on borderlines. Another layer focus on the object colors and another the physical dimensions of the house.

Deep learning systems need powerful softwares. This is because they process vast amounts of data and complex mathematical calculations.

### Why we need Deep Learning

Deep learning is revolutionizing so many fields, from robotics to medicine solving problems. Deep learning is an excellent and powerful tool. It helps many organizations and developers create exciting AI applications. Think of successful surgeries without causing human loss due to surgical errors. Think of a world with no accident due to smart cars. Several years to come, the world will be on another level due to deep learning.

### Applications of Deep Learning

There is massive excitement about artificial intelligence and its branches. Here are deep learning applications that will rule the world.

1. Self-driven cars

Companies such as Google are building driver assistance services. Also, they are teaching computers how to use digital sensors instead of human sensors. These companies train deep learning algorithms to use [large amounts of data](https://medium.com/breathe-publication/top-15-deep-learning-applications-that-will-rule-the-world-in-2018-and-beyond-7c6130c43b01).

2. Natural Language Processing

Machines are taught to understand complexities associated with languages such as semantics. To achieve this, [NLP through deep learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/natural-language-processing-tutorial/) plays a major role. NLP also catch linguistic nuances and frame appropriate responses.

3. Healthcare

Deep learning is completely revolutionizing the healthcare and the medical industries. According to [Medium](https://medium.com/breathe-publication/top-15-deep-learning-applications-that-will-rule-the-world-in-2018-and-beyond-7c6130c43b01), AI has enabled healthcare and medical industries to advance tremendously. DL is being used by clinical researchers to find a cure for untreatable diseases. It helps with a speedy diagnostic of dangerous conditions. Many cancer tests, such as the Pap test for cervical cancer, use Deep Learning to look at cells image under a microscope.

4. Virtual Assistants

The most popular deep learning virtual assistants are Siri and Google Assistants. Deep learning enables virtual assistants to learn and understand commands given by a user. Virtual assistants then execute by giving the appropriate answer naturally. Virtual assistants use deep learning to know more about you, from what you search most.

5. Fraud Detection

Banking and financial sectors are benefiting from Deep Learning to detect transaction fraud. [Autoencoders](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/deep-learning-applications/) in Tensor flow are being developed to detect credit card frauds, thus saving a lot of money from fraudsters. Fraud detection and prevention are done based on identifying patterns in customer transactions.

6. Image Recognition

Image recognition using deep learning aims to recognize and identify objects in images. Also, deep learning aims to understand their context and content. Image recognition is mostly used in gaming and social media.

7 Entertainment

Entertainment industries such as [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ke-en/) recommends to their viewers what they need. Deep learning enables the entertainment industry to understand the consumers behavior. This helps to provide an exciting experience to clients. Deep Learning is revolutionizing the filmmaking process. Cameras can learn body language and conduct voice synthesis. Deep learning also helps to emulate someones voice to imbibe in virtual characters.

### Working of Neural networks

Neural Networks are algorithms modeled to function like the human brain. Neural Networks is a system of hardware and software patterned after neurons operation in the human mind. Neurons are decision-makers.

Neural networks comprise of the input layer, hidden layers, and the output layer. The input layer is where the neural network receives the data represented with numbers. Any data can be represented as a number, whether it is words, sound, or image. Each input neuron represents a single feature. Once the features have data, it is sent to every neuron in the next layer, which is the hidden layer. There are many hidden layers. Each hidden layer mathematically combines all the numbers it gets. The major goal is measuring whether the data inputted has various components. Each neuron then sends its number to the next layer neuron, either a hidden or output layer. The output layer is where the final layer, outputs get combined mathematically to solve the problems. Neural networks work with numbers. Math is the key to Neural Networks, Artificial intelligence, and its branches [machine learning and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
