### Introduction

In this tutorial, I'll be discussing the concepts of the Node.js Express generator tool. It's a package that you can use to simplify your development time while developing your Node.js web applications.  

As the name suggests, an Express generator is a tool that we'll be using to generate our application, that otherwise, we would've created manually.

### Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be in a position to generate complete Node application folders.  

### Prerequisites

- [Node](node.org) installed in your local machine
- Basics of Node.js template engines, in this application we use `pug`.

### Generating Express application

In this section, we look at the Express generator package, how it's installed and used to generate folder structure.  

Let's start by installing the Express generator via the node package manager(npm).  

```bash
npx express-generator --view=pug expressExample

```

In the above command, we instruct the express-generator to generate an application called `expressExample`. We then specify the view that we need our application to use, in our case we select `pug`. There are many other view template engines that you could find [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html)

Output:

The above error is just a warning that `jade` will not be supported in the future, otherwise enter `y` to proceed.

Output:

```bash
create : expressExample/
   create : expressExample/public/
   create : expressExample/public/javascripts/
   create : expressExample/public/images/
   create : expressExample/public/stylesheets/
   create : expressExample/public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : expressExample/routes/
   create : expressExample/routes/index.js
   create : expressExample/routes/users.js
   create : expressExample/views/
   create : expressExample/views/error.pug
   create : expressExample/views/index.pug
   create : expressExample/views/layout.pug
   create : expressExample/app.js
   create : expressExample/package.json
   create : expressExample/bin/
   create : expressExample/bin/www

   change directory:
     $ cd express examples

   install dependencies:
     $ npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=expressexample:* npm start


```

The above output gives you an overview of your project folder structure while the immediate instruction is for us to install dependencies for this application and run the execution.

```bash
cd expressExample
```

```bash
npm install
```

This will install your node application dependencies for a few seconds, depending on your internet speed.  

On completion, in your Mac or Linux system, run the following command to start your application:  

```bash
DEBUG=expressexample:* npm start
```

Output:

```bash
> expressexample@0.0.0 start
> node ./bin/www

  expressexample:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms


```

In case you're using windows based operating system, run the following command to start your application.

```bash
> set DEBUG=expressexample:* & npm start
```

While could also run it on the Windows PowerShell as follows:  

```powershell

PS> $env:DEBUG='expressexample:*'; npm start
```

Now open the browser and enter the following URL:

```http
http://localhost:3000
```

Output:
![express applicaiton example](/engineering-education/node-app-express-generator/home.png)

Our final project folder structure:  

```
expressExample
├── app.js
├── bin
│   └── www
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── public
│   ├── images
│   ├── javascripts
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── style.css
├── routes
│   ├── index.js
│   └── users.js
└── views
    ├── error.pug
    ├── index.pug
    └── layout.pug
├── node_modules
    ├── packages you installed on the npm install command

```

Now that we have a completely well-structured application, let's take a look at an example of how we can use these generated files to create an application.

Open the `index.pug` file on `` directory and add the following:  

```html

extends layout

block content
  h1= title
  p This is my first express application generated by the Express Generator package
  p To print this view, you require knowledge using Pug

```

Now open your `app.js` in your project directory and modify as shown below:  

```js

...............................................
var createError = require('http-errors');
// we are importing the express package
const express = require('express');
// this line imports the path
const path = require('path');

// these packages will aid in application routing
const homePageRouter = require('./routes/home');
const studentEngineeringRouter = require('./routes/engineering-education');

//these packages are used to parse cookie values
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const logger = require('morgan');


const app = express();

// the following lines are used to setup view templates for our application
// you can also set views of your choice here.

app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

// we directing the application of which pages to use
app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use('/home', homePageRouter);
app.use('/engineering-education', studentEngineeringRouter);

// this method catches error Not Found
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {

  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;


```

You notice that you just modify the routes and any other feature on the Express generated application as a normal node initialised app.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've discussed how to generate an Node-express application using the express generator. We generated a project structure and started our application on the server and displayed an ouput. We've also seen how we can modify this applicaiton to suit our needs.

Happy coding!
