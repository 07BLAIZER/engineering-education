MariaDB framework is amongst the most popular database servers in the world. [Google Inc.](https://about.google/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) are some of the users of MariaDB. MariaDB changes data into information structured for various applications, including powering websites and supporting the banking sector.

The original developers of MariaDB enhanced MariaDB for MySQL. MariaDB was forked from MySQL. All structure components of MariaDB are similar to those of MySQL.

MariaDB is developed as an open-source software and is a relational database providing an SQL interface for data access. The database server attracts users as it is robust, scalable, and fast. Its vast ecosystem of plugins, storage engines, amongst other tools, makes it unique for numerous use cases.

This article discusses MariaDB, MySQL and their key features. It also compares the two to help you choose the best database server that suits your needs.

### An overview of MariaDB

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) framework is a default type of MySQL database system found as a common source of most Linux distributions. It works on operating systems such as macOS and Windows. MySQL is mostly used as a database replacement (or as a database option) in the LEMP ([Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-lemp)) and LAMP ([Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)#)) stack.

[Oracle Corporation](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/) acquired MySQL in 2009. MariaDB was introduced later as concerns were raised about MySQL being open-source and freely accessible to users. Maintainers and developers do monthly mergers with MySQL code base to ensure MariaDB has bug fixes added to MySQL.

MariaDB is available under the GPL ([General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)) license, version 2. Supply of client libraries for Open Database Connectivity ([ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity)), Java, and C are available under LGP ([Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html)) license, version 2.1 and higher.

MariaDB server exists in two editions; [MariaDB Community Server](https://mariadb.com/docs/features/mariadb-community-server/) and [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://mariadb.com/docs/features/mariadb-enterprise-server/). You can download, modify and use the MariaDB Community Server for free. You can substitute proprietary databases in the enterprise to adjust to open-source using MariaDB Enterprise Server. MariaDB uses a server/client model with a program that files needs from client programs. It is possible to have the client and server programs on different hosts.

### An overview of MySQL

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was developed as a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). RDBMS is a model that structures data into columns and rows. A primary key distinctively identifies each row for the use of SQL jargon. These keys are pegs used by tables to outline a relation to a particular row. A primary key column in one table refers to a foreign key in a relatable database table.

### Key features of MariaDB framework

- _Backward compatibility_ - MariaDB data files are binary compatible with the MySQL version. Also, MySQL client protocol is compatible with MariaDB client protocol.
- _Open-source software_ - It is open-source and developed by the community as a true open-source spirit proving that it is genuinely open-source.
- It is based on MySQL community Version and a [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) based on other MySQL Fork Server and MySQL Server.
- MariaDB supports many different SQL statements, rules, procedures, functions, user-defined functions, SQL modes, and server variables. It has ships with various plugins like the MariaDB audit plugin.
- It has new storage engines such as [XtraDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-xtradb/), [PBXT](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/pbxt-storage-engine/), [FederatedX](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-federatedx/).
- MariaDB has various new options, extensions, bug fixes extensions, and storage engines.

### Key features of MySQL Framework

- _Scalability and flexibility_ - The framework allows multi-threading, making it scalable. It can manage any amount of data. Its flexibility supports many applications.
- _High performance_ - MySQL is a fast database language with numerous benchmark tests. It is more reliable and cheap considering its unique storage engine architecture that provides high performance, unlike other databases. It performs efficiently without losing crucial functions of the software. It has various cache memories.
- _Ease of use_ - MySQL is easy to use. You only need basic knowledge of SQL to interact and write codes using SQL statements.
- _It has client/server architecture_ - The framework follows a client/server architecture. In such architectures, there is a database server and many clients who communicate with the server. Application programs communicate with the server and save changes and query data.
- _It is secure_ - MySQL consists of strong data security that secures sensitive data from malicious people. Passwords in MySQL are encrypted.

### Key differences between MariaDB and MySQL

| Feature | MariaDB | MySQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage engines
 | It contains 12 new engine stores that do not exist in MySQL. | It has fewer storage options than MariaDB. |
| Speed improvements | MariaDB has improved speed. | MySQL is not as fast as MariaDB. |
| Larger, faster connection pool | It has an advanced connection pool that can run and faster and support more than [200,000](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/incompatibilities-and-feature-differences-between-mariadb-103-and-mysql-57/) connections. | It cannot manage 200,000 connections at a time. |
| New extensions/ features | MariaDB has new extensions and features, including [WITH](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/with/), [JSON](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/json-functions/), [KILL](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql_kill/) statements. | The new features found in MariaDB do not exist in MySQL. |
| Priority code | MySQL uses propriety code in the Enterprise Edition. | MariaDB does not allow access to propriety content as it is a closed source. |

### Conclusion

MariaDB offers better performance with more updates and an open-source feature. MySQL has a strong following globally. This comparison has helped you decide which database server makes could fit your situation. It would be best to determine whether you are satisfied with a database supported by a large company or an open-source one that is faster and updated as a drop-in replacement for the other.
