In this tutorial, we will learn how to authenticate users with their email and password using Firebase's authentication module in a Non-Expo React Native application.

### Firebase

Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

Firebase's authentication module provides backend services and SDKs to authenticate users in your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

### Prerequisites

The basics of React and React Native will not be covered in this tutorial. If you are not comfortable with the basics, this is a [helpful tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial).

### Overview

We'll be going through these steps in this article:

1. Development environment.
2. Cloning the starter code.
3. Installing dependencies.
4. Setting up the Firebase project.
5. Setting up Firebase Authentication.
6. Create Account.
7. Sign in to Existing Account.
8. Authenticated Screen.
9. Signout.
10. Recap.

### Development environment

> **IMPORTANT** - We will not be using [Expo](https://expo.io/) in our project.

You can follow [this documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up the environment and create a new React app.

Make sure you're following the React Native CLI Quickstart, not the Expo CLI Quickstart.

### Cloning the starter code

To focus more on the authentication module, You can clone the starter code from this [repository](https://github.com/zolomohan/rn-firebase-phone-auth-starter) on GitHub. Follow the Repository's README for instructions.

For the final code, you can look at this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zolomohan/rn-firebase-phone-auth).

This will be the folder structure of the application.

I've set up 2 screens in the `screens/` directory:

- _Authentication.js_: Screen to login or create account.

- _Authenticated.js_: Screen that the user can see only if he is logged in.

In the _App.js_, the *Authentication* screen is exported. As we write the code for the, we will conditionally display the *Authenticated* screen after authenticating the user.

### Installing dependencies

You can install these in advance or while going through the article.

```JSON
"@react-native-firebase/app": "^10.5.0",
"@react-native-firebase/auth": "^10.5.1",
"react": "16.13.1",
"react-native": "0.63.4"
```

To install a dependency, run:

```bash
npm i --save <package-name>
```

After installing the packages, for iOS, go into your `ios/` directory, and run:

```bash
pod install
```

> **IMPORTANT FOR ANDROID**
>
> Adding more native dependencies may bump you over the 64k method limit on the Android build system. If you reach this limit, you will see the following error while attempting to build your Android application.
>
> `Execution failed for task ':app:mergeDexDebug'.`
>
> Use [this documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/enabling-multidex) to enable multidexing.
> To learn more about multidex, view the official [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#mdex-gradle).

### Setting up the Firebase project

Head to the [Firebase console](console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and sign in to your account.

Create a new project.

![Create New Project](firebase_new.png)

Once you create a new project, you'll see the dashboard.

![New Dashboard](new_dashboard.png)

Now, click on the Android icon to add an android app to the Firebase project.

![register_app](register_app.png)

You will need the package name of the application to register application. You can find the package name in the `AndroidManifest.xml` which is located in `android/app/src/main/`.

Now, Proceed to the next step, you can download the `google-services.json` file. You should place this file in the `android/app` directory.

This file contains configurations that'll enable your application to access firebase services.

![Download Google Services JSON](download_services.json.png)

After adding the file, proceed to the next step. It will ask you to add some configurations to the `build.gradle` files.

First, add the `google-services` plugin as a dependency inside of your `android/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies

    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
  }
}
```

Then, execute the plugin by adding the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```Gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

You need to perform some additional steps to configure `Firebase` for `iOS`. Follow [this documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#3-ios-setup) to set it up.

Finally, We should install the `@react-native-firebase/app` package in our app to complete the set up for Firebase.

```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/app
```

### Setting up Firebase Authentication

Head over to the Authentication section in the dashboard and click on the `Get Started` button. This will enable the authentication module in your project.

![Get Started Auth](auth_get_starterd.png)

Next, you should enable email/password authentication in the sign-in methods. Once you've enabled it, press save.

![Enable Email](enabled_email.png)

Let's install the `@react-native-firebase/auth` package in our app.

```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/auth
```

Let's declare the dependency for the authentication module in the `android/app/build.gradle` file using the [Firebase Android BoM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/learn-more?authuser=0#bom)

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Add these lines
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:26.3.0')
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
}
```

With this, the firebase authentication module is set up in our application.
