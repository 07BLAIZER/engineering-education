### Introduction 
In todayâ€™s world, files are highly exchanged, especially over the internet. For interaction, HTML also allows the upload of files, this ranges from images, videos to pdf documents. Websites use these files for various uses such as profile pictures and also exchange of information among users in web apps. In this tutorial, we will look at how to use HTML forms and PHP to allow the uploading of files to a website.
 

 ### Prerequisites
  Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have prior knowledge in creating HTML forms, databases in MySQL.You can check out a simple guide on how to create forms in HTMl [here](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/working-with-forms-in-php/).
 
  
  Since we will be using PHP, make sure you have installed Xampp to help in running the PHP code.You can download Xampp [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
 
 **In this tutorial, we will be using Windows.**
  Once the installation is complete, start the  Xampp control panel and activate  Apache by clicking the start button as highlighted below.

  After a few seconds, the Apache header should change to a green background to indicate the apache server is running .check this image for reference.![Apache running image ](/engineering-education/managing-file-uploads-in-html-forms-using-php/apachesuccess.jpg)  

  ### Creating the PHP files 
  Navigate to `C:\xampp\htdocs\`(the driver location will depend on where you installed your Xampp app ) and create a new folder `test`. 

  We shall move to create a new file  `(index.php)` under the `test` folder, this is where we will be writing all the code for this tutorial.

  In the `index.php` file insert the following code:
  ``` php
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
             <title>HTML Form</title>
      </head>
      <body>
            <h1>Form</h1>
            <form method="POST" action="index.php" enctype="multipart/form-data" >
              <label  class="form-label">Name</label>
              <input type="text" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" name="name" required > <br><br>
               file : <input type="file" name="file"><br><br>
                
               <br/>
               <input type="submit" value="submit"  name="submit">
             </form>
       </body>
       </html>
  ```
  To view the output of  this code, head to your browser at http://localhost/test here we append our folder name test to the base URL  for our Apache server `http://localhost/`
  From the browser, You should be having something like this .![form output](/engineering-education/managing-file-uploads-in-html-forms-using-php/formlayout.jpg)
  
   

  
  ### Creating the PHP logic to handle the file uploads 
   In the form we created above, once we click the submit button an action seems to be taking place. Although the file we choose to upload seems to have been uploaded, we cannot locate them. 

   To make this form save the uploaded file on our preferred location, we will be creating a PHP script to handle the submitting process.

   There are usually two common ways of handling the above situation.
         * saving a file on a table record - In this way we save the files in a folder and then save the reference on the database.
         *  Saving the file directly on the database - in this way we save the files as binary files(BLOB), However, this way is not efficient especially in situations where large files are to be uploaded. This is because it will slow the database access as records increase.


   **Saving the file on a table record.**

    When saving files on a table record, we follow several steps, as follows.
 1. Creating a database -> Head to the xampp control panel and start MySQL, click the admin button to access the `phpMyAdmin` dashboard; this is where we will create our database.![mysql button](/engineering-education/managing-file-uploads-in-html-forms-using-php/mysqlbutton.jpg).
 The admin button on the MySQL row should take you to your browser and display this.

 2. Connecting to a database -> For  this tutorial we will be using mysqli.
      * On our `index.php` file , under the closing html tag lets add the following php script.
          ```PHP
            <?php
               $server='localhost';
               $user= "root";
               $password ="";
               $dbname="tutorial";
               $conn= mysqli_connect($server,$user,$password, $dbname) or die ("could not connect to the database");

            ?>
          ```
      The code above allows us to connect to our database, the `$server` variable stores the name of the server where our database is located. For the `$user` and `$password`variables, data about the user is stored. `$password ` is empty in our case because in our apache server we have not set any .`$dbname` stores our database name. 

      We will use the `$conn` variable to connect to the database. To ensure the connection is working we use the `die` function to end the connection and give us feedback in case the connection fails.
 3. Getting the file from the form -> when a user uploads a file in our form, we need to get the file and store it in our preferred location. To perform this, add a new folder inside the test folder and name it uploads.
     This code will get the file from the forms. Insert it in our PHP script just below `$conn`.
       ```PHP
            if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
                  $name = $_FILES['file']['name'];
                  //the directory to upload to
                  $targetDir = "uploads/";
                  //the file being upload
                  $targetFile = $targetDir.basename($_FILES['file']['name']);
                  //select the file type - file extension
                  $fileType = strtolower(pathinfo($targetFile,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
                  
                   
              
            }
     ```
     We use an if statement to check whether the user has clicked the submit button, if true the file name will be stored in `$name`.Since we created our preferred storage location, we use `$targetDir` to indicate where will store our file.
     

     In some cases, we might want to restrict the type of files uploaded. Different files have different extensions which enable us to filter the files. 
     Insert the following code below `$fileType`.  

     ```PHP
        //valid file extensions we will allow
        $extensions_arr= array("jpg","jpeg","png");
        //checking the extension of our uploaded file
        if( in_array($fileType,$extensions_arr) ){
            // Insert record
            $query = " INSERT into `files` (`filename`) values('$name')";
            mysqli_query($conn,$query);
            // Upload file
            move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'],$targetDir.$name);
            } else echo " wrong file type ";

         
     ```
      In this tutorial we will limit the type to only photos.`$extensions_arr`stores the file type we will allow. Let us check whether our file has any of the above extensions, the `in_array`function checks if a value exists in an array. If the statement is true, we shall create a query to Insert the file's name into our database. This acts as a reference to our file which will be stored in the `uploads` folder.

      In case the file type does not match the extensions in our array, we will return an error message using the `echo` function.

      ###### Retrieving the file
      To Retrieve the file we stored in our database , we need to query the database for the files name . Since we only stored the file name and not the file name itself, the result from the query is matched to the files in our folder the displayed.
      ```php
         $sql = "SELECT  `filename` FROM `files` WHERE `filename`= '$name'";
         $result = mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
         $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
         $image = $row['filename'];
         $image_src = "uploads/".$image
      ```
      Our file type was images , to display it ,we will add an image tag after the closing tag of our PHP script .
      This code will display the image we have uploaded in our database.
      ```php
         <img src='<?php echo $image_src; ?>' >
      ```
     Our final code will be as shown below.
     ```PHP  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
          <head>
             <title>HTML Form</title>
      </head>
      <body>
            <h1>Form</h1>
            <form method="POST" action="index.php" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <label for="exampleInputEmail1" class="form-label">Name</label>
                <input type="text" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" name="name" required aria-describedby="emailHelp"> <br><br>
               File : <input type="file" name="file"><br><br>
                
               <br/>
               <input type="submit" value="submit"  name= "submit">
             </form>
       </body>
       </html>
       
       <?php
         $server='localhost';
         $user= "root";
         $password ="";
         $dbname="tutorial";
         $conn= mysqli_connect($server,$user,$password, $dbname) or die ("could not connect to the database");

         if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
          $fileName = $_POST['name'];
          $name = $_FILES['file']['name'];
          $targetDir = "uploads/";
          $targetFile = $targetDir.basename($_FILES['file']['name']);
          $fileType = strtolower(pathinfo($targetFile,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
          $extensions_arr= array("jpg","jpeg","png");
          if( in_array($fileType,$extensions_arr) ){
            // Insert record
            $query = " INSERT into `files` (`filename`) values('$name')";
            mysqli_query($conn,$query);
            // Upload file
            move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'],$targetDir.$name);
            } else echo " wrong file type ";
          
          }
          $sql = "SELECT  `filename` FROM `files` WHERE `filename`= '$name'";
          $result = mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
          $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
          $image = $row['filename'];
          $image_src = "uploads/".$image;
       ?>
       <img src='<?php echo $image_src; ?>' >
      
       
     ```
      
      Happy Coding.
