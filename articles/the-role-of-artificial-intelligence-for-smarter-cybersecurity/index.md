Organizations continue to embrace the Internet of Things (IoT), the cloud, and mobile technology. This has influenced considerable changes in the threat landscape and created more vulnerability points. Cybercriminals are leveraging these new vulnerability points to develop and launch sophisticated, high-volume, multi-dimensional attacks. Such attacks mean that data is at risk, and organizations must spend valuable time analyzing potentially malicious files.

Using artificial intelligence software, organizations can process large volumes of threat data and adequately prevent and respond to breaches and hacks. This article will discuss how machine learning and artificial intelligence improve cybersecurity in four critical areas: network security, data centers, threat hunting, and vulnerability management.

### Network Security

Network security mainly focuses on the understanding of network topography and creating a security policy of an organization. Securities policies can help to distinguish legitimate network connections from illegitimate ones. But drafting and maintaining policies for multiple networks may be challenging.

Often, some organizations may not have a precise naming convention for workloads and applications. This means that network security teams have to spend significant time attaching different workloads to given applications.

These activities are time-consuming, and the use of artificial intelligence technology can come in handy. AI can expedite these processes by learning and observing traffic patterns and suggesting security policies. This way, organizations save on time, resources, and effort. The organization can allocate these to other areas of technological advancement or development.

### Data Centers

Cyber attackers target [data centers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/what-is-a-data-center.html) in an attempt to obtain critical data. Cybersecurity has improved over the years with advancements in technology. Being aware of this, cybercriminals regularly develop more advanced malware strains to ensure successful cyber-attacks on organizations&#39; networks.

Organizations can deploy artificial intelligence technology in their data centers to enhance data security. To ensure data security, AI essentially learns normal network behavior. It then detects cyber threats with regard to the variations from the regular network behavior.

The application of AI in a data center can help identify security loopholes and detect malware in data center systems. Most importantly, AI-based cybersecurity can analyze or screen outgoing and incoming data security threats.

### Threat Hunting

The asymmetric nature of cybersecurity is an inherent problem that seems to empower the acts of attackers. With this state, cyber-attackers need to only be successful once by exploiting just a single weakness while the defenders must be successful every time. Preventing threats requires more than just ensuring security data. It calls for combing threats on an entire [information technology stack](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/technology-stack).

In this case, AI is essential to identify abnormalities, outliers, and patterns in all data without the need for applying fixed rules. Human analysts depend on this output for investigation and action. This is what is often referred to as threat hunting in security language. It involves narrowing down threats by collaborating security analytics and machine intelligence, and advanced human cognition.

### Vulnerability Management

Every year, there are many reported vulnerabilities to cybersecurity. It is extremely difficult to manage these unique vulnerabilities with traditional technology or human resources. Systems that use machine learning and artificial intelligence do not wait for online attackers to exploit existing vulnerabilities. Rather, these systems are proactive in finding potential vulnerabilities in information systems.

They rely on multiple factors such as hackers&#39; patterns, the reputation of the hacker, and the hacker&#39;s conversations on the dark web. AI-ML systems analyze these factors and use the insights to assess how and when threats might attack vulnerable targets.

### Negative Effects of AI on Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity experts have embraced AI due to its significance in the industry. But besides being a solution, AI can pose considerable threats to businesses.

Artificial intelligence relies on supervised learning. In this case, algorithms label data sets depending on their nature. This could be clean data, malware, or some other tag. If cybercriminals get access to the security firm, they can alter the label to suit their interests.

Besides, advanced hacking campaigns can use machine learning technology to manipulate routine tasks relying on artificial intelligence.

AI can identify irregularities and abnormalities in a network, deduce patterns from data, and analyze user behaviors. With this information, identifying cyber vulnerabilities becomes easier. However, cyberattackers can provide malicious cyber programs that imitate legitimate AI-based algorithms, which means that the information might be susceptible to cybercrime.

### The Future of AI and Cybersecurity

The future of the application of artificial intelligence to improve cybersecurity looks promising. Security teams expect AI to enhance and respond better to cyber-attacks. Human analysts are designing better defense strategies, and AI will replicate the best methods to ensure cybersecurity. Response speed to threats will improve, and human experts will be freed up to handle more complicated investigations.

Artificial intelligence&#39;s natural language is predictably capable of understanding the origination of cyberattacks. In the future, we will see this principle put into effect by scanning data across the internet.

The next-generation firewalls will possibly have a powerful in-built machine learning technology. This will help in finding patterns in network packets and blocking them automatically if flagged as a threat.

### Conclusion

Artificial intelligence promotes cybersecurity in many different ways. Lately, cybersecurity teams have amplified the use of AI to augment their efforts to ensure information security. Cyber-attacks are very dynamic, and AI is imperative to provide much-needed analysis and threat identification. Attackers also take advantage of AI to find loopholes in cybersecurity and plan attacks. The use of AI in cybersecurity is expected to advance in the future, thus ensuring that systems can better respond to attacks.
