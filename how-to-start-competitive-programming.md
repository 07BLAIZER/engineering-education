### A Complete Roadmap
All the big companies' hiring programs generally have technical interviews. These interviews usually consist of coding rounds. Data Structures & Algorithms come handy in solving these rounds. Since these are the core parts of Competitive Programming, it becomes a very good option to ace the interviews. This is a blog post meant to many people who have ever tried to start competitive programming but didn't find where to go ahead and left in midway. And also to those who wonder where to start from, to enter this wonderful kingdom.

Without wasting any time, let's dig in deep & start discussing about every major aspect of Competitive Programming by answering all the **Why(s), What(s) & How(s)!**

### What is Competitive Programming?
As Wiki says,
*Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications.*

**Long story, short:** It is a type of contest where a number of programmers take part to solve some programming questions in a limited amount of time. You can write your solution in any programming language youâ€™re comfortable with. Your solutions will be judged by online judges. It should pass all the test cases (given and hidden) to get accepted under certain time and space limits.

A lot of big tech companies like Facebook and Google hire through Competitive programming competitions too. Various online competitions have some amazing prizes for the winners as well.

### Why Competitive Programming? What are the benefits?

#### Crack the Coding Interviews:
Normally in coding interviews, easy and medium level questions of competitive coding are asked with some fewer tweaks. Performing well in online platforms provides confidence in coding interviews and get internships & job offers from reputed companies.

#### Problem Solving Skills:
One of the real benefits of competitive coding comes when we start solving problems on our own. In most of the contest, you will be given some real-word problems and you need to solve them in the best possible way in limited time. This increases our analytical and thinking abilities. Our logic building improves and thus helping a lot in developing real-life products.

#### Strengthen your Software Practices:
It helps us to build up logic thinking skills, write clean code, better understand the functions and modules, analyze and interpret several alternatives & features, and finally bring meaningful insight to the software products.

#### Land a Position in your Dream Company:
Various companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. conduct online coding competitions and they directly hire candidates based on their performance in the competition.

#### Working as a Team:
Most coding competitions happen in groups of 2-4 people. Different individuals can be a great learning experience. Coming up with different energies gives a good platform to nurture our skills in a different environment. Having proper coordination and management skills is the key to ace these coding competitions.

### How do I get started? Is there a roadmap or a guide?

#### Pick a suitable programming language:
You can do competitive programming in any programming language but it is highly recommended that you choose one of C/C++, Java, or even Python. Learn about all the syntaxes, built-in functions, templates, snippets, and library functions such as STL in C++, Big Integers in Java, etc. Working with the fundamentals will bring long term benefit to any individual.

#### Choose a powerful code editor:
You will be solving up many problems. To increase the speed and efficiency of your work, it is recommended you write your codes in a code editor. VS Code, Sublime Text 3, Pharm & Vim are some of the popular editors where you use their cool features and practice your craft. Use STL, snippets, and templates whenever you can. It not only saves your code length but also decreases the time to write your code. Now you can focus mainly on solving the actual logic of the problems.

#### Choose a few platforms to practice & start participating in contests:
There are so many platforms on the list.
Let's count - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-1/tutorial/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)...
A beginner should always start with [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)!
It has a good set of problems placed in a well-defined manner according to the tags & difficulty levels and undoubtedly has the best user interface & IDE. For references about the Data Structures & Algorithms, one should always consider [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and the original documentations like [CPPreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).
After solving sufficient problems, jump into the actual game arena, i.e., Codeforces & Codechef. Practice as many problems as you can, whenever you get stuck over some problems, go check out contest's editorials and the discussion sections as well.

#### Learn the basic Data Structures and Algorithm concepts:
Nearly every coding problem will require the usage of a specific data structure or algorithm for an optimal solution. Knowing basic data structures and algorithmic techniques before you start is a must. Data Structures and Algorithms are something that helps you in making the program more efficient. Having a good amount of knowledge in DSA will help you in selecting the optimal Data Structure for any problem and implementing it with the most optimal logic. Geeksforgeeks is your one-stop destination for all the Data Structures and Algorithm concepts. It has a wide variety of articles on various data structures & trivial and non-trivial algorithms.

#### Solving Different Problems:
Repeatedly solving similar problems is not going to benefit you in the long run. It will keep you in the wrong bubble. Instead, start solving sufficiently different problems until you master that concept diligently and then jumps to another one. Also, it might help to try to and solve the problem initially with pen & paper. This will give you the right foundation and proper roadmap to deliver large, scale, optimized, and bug-free codes.  


### Platform Problems and How to approach them?
#### Problem Statement:
Always give yourself enough time to read the problem statement, carefully. Don't be in a hurry, when you are reading the problem because this may result in the wrong interpretation of the problem and as a result of this, you will write the wrong code. Remember, 40% of the problem is already solved by merely understanding the statement carefully.

### Important points:
Break the whole problem into smaller sub-problems, these are easier to handle. So, while reading the problem, make a note of important points that you are going to solve.

### Constraints:
Before writing the code, you should look for the input/output constraints given in the question. This will help you in deciding the time complexity of your code and you need not change the code again and again because if the code is not according to the constraints, then you will get the TLE error.

### Input/Output format:
Always take input in the given format and never use your own format. If you are not following it, then you will get the wrong answer instead of having the right code.

### Write the code and test:
After deciding the time complexity, write the code and first test your code for the sample input, and if it passes then submit your code and test for other test cases. Also, try to dry run the code for boundary/edge cases, this will help in testing our code for hidden test cases.

### More details on Online Competitions:
- Always participate in online coding competitions that happens regularly on various websites. This is the best tool to measure your growing skillset, where you currently stand, and in which areas you need to more practice. By rectifying our mistakes & failures and working over the same, we eventually help ourselves make that long leap to success.
Also, the cherry on top, is that there are also captivating rewards in these competitions for the winners.

### 3 P's to the Success -- Practice, Patience, Proceed
- To master this art of programming, one has to ***practice*** and practice really hard. The road to being a really good coder is very difficult, you will face setbacks at some times, highs & lows, and days with no fruitful results. Here, ***patience*** is the key to overcome all the issues.

- Consult editorials, online references, youtube tutorials, different approaches for the solution, and read other contestant's codes after the completion of the contest. Keep believing in yourself and eventually, there will come a time when you can ***proceed*** to the next stage after successfully solving the phase.

- There is so much more to tell about the same. I'll be discussing them in detail in another blog. Remember there is no shortcut for success. The harder the path, the better the fruit will be. ***Till then practice, have fun, and learn a lot.***
