
### Introduction
The term "Language-Integrated Query" (LINQ) refers to a group of technologies that incorporate query capabilities directly into the C# programming language. Querying data has traditionally been plain text, with no type checking or IntelliSense assistance at build time. LINQ access data from objects, data sets, SQL Server, and XML, among other things.

### Generating sequences with LINQ
Make sure the below three lines are at the very top of the Program.cs file produced by dotnet new console before you begin. For our program to run, the lines below should be in the program so that the results shall be obtained as expected
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generics;
using System.Linq;
```
Consider what comprises a collection of cards now that you've got all the necessary references. One set of cards used in playing various games usually comprises four suites, each with thirteen values. Normally, you'd consider starting with a Card class and manually filling a compilation of those cards objects. With LINQ, one can see a long text with fewer words than you can with the traditional method of generating a pack of playing cards. A class called card may be initiated, but Suits and rankings are represented by sequences, sequences that may be built as two of them. You will then write a pair of straightforward iterator methods to generate the rankings and suits as IEnumerable<T>s of strings.
```c#
static IEnumerable<String> Suits()
{
    yield returns "diamonds";
    yield returns "hearts";
    yield returns "spades";
    yield returns "clubs";
}
static IEnumerable<string> Ranks()
{
    yield returns "seven";
    yield returns "eight";
    yield returns "ten";
    yield returns "nine"; 
    yield returns "six";
    yield returns "five";
    yield returns "four";
    yield returns "three"; 
    yield returns "two";
    yield returns "king";
    yield returns "ace";
    yield returns "jack";
    yield returns "queen";
}
```
The multiple clauses generate a SelectMany, which combines each element from the first and second sequences into a single sequence. The order is crucial to achieving our goals. The first element in the first source sequence (Suits) is related to every element in the second series (Ranks). As a consequence, all thirteen cards of the first suit are produced. The initial sequence's elements are all treated to the same method (Suits). The final product is a park of playing cards arranged by suit, then by value.
  
```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var initialPart=from s in Suitx()
                     from r in Ranky()
                     select new { Suitx=s,Ranky=r};
    foreach(var card in initialPart)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("card");
    }                 
                    
}
```
In your Program.cs file, put them after the Main method. Both of these methods use the yield return syntax to generate a sequence as they execute. The compiler creates an object that implements IEnumerableT> and generates the specified sequence of strings.

### Manipulate the order of things.
Think about how you'd mix the cards in the deck. Splitting the deck in half is the first step in any decent shuffle. This capability is provided by the LINQ APIs' Take and Skip functions. Place them beneath the `foreach` loop as shown below.
  
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var initialPart = from s in Suits()
                       from r in Ranks()
                       select new { Suit = s, Rank = r };

    foreach (var x in initialPart)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }
    var top = initialPart .Take(26);
    var bottom = initialPart.Skip(26);
}
```
However, the standard library does not have a shuffle method, so you'll have to develop your own. Because the shuffle method you'll be writing demonstrates various strategies you'll use with LINQ-based programming; We will break down each step.

To extend the functionality of how you can work with the IEnumerable returned by LINQ queries, you'll need to create extension methods. In a nutshell, an extension method can be said to be a static method with a specific purpose that adds additional functionality to an existing type without needing the original type to be changed.
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace myShuffle
{
    public static class Extension1
    {
        public static IEnumerable<T> InterleaveSequenceWith<T>(this IEnumerablex<T> FirstInLine, IEnumerablex<T> NextInLine)
        {
             // Your code shall be written here
        }
    }
}
```
### Identifying the difference between an eager and a sluggish evaluation.
Lazy evaluation means that each call to the iterator only processes a single element from the source collection. Depending on the circumstances, an iterator can be a custom class, a `foreach`, or a while loop.
  
```c#
public static class Fibonacci
{
    public static IEnumerable<long> Series()
    {
        long prevX1 = 1;
        long prevX2 = 1;

        yield return prevX1;

        yield return prevX2;

        while(true)
        {
            long temp = prevX1 + prevX2;
            prevX1 = prevX2;
            prevX2 = temp;
            yield return temp;
        }
    }
}
```
Eager evaluation is the evaluation method used by most conventional programming languages.
```c#
IEnumerable<int> myMethod()
{
    for(int i=0; i <=900; i++)
    {
        yield return I;
    }
}
...

var ex = myMethod.Take(2);
var list = ex.ToList();
```
The yield keyword allows the collection to be evaluated gradually. Eager evaluation is the process of forcing the entire collection into memory. When you call ToList, `ToDictionary`, or ToArray, the enumeration is evaluated immediately, and all elements are returned in a collection.

### Identifying places in your code where LINQ queries may have performance difficulties
The sample we created above performs an out shuffle, with the top and bottom cards remaining unchanged on every run. Let's make one alteration. Instead of an out shuffle, we'll employ an in the shuffle, in which all 52 cards shift positions. As a result, the top half's final card becomes the bottom half's final card. This is a straightforward modification to a single line of code. Switch the Take and Skip locations in the current shuffle query to update it. The top and bottom half of the deck will now be in reverse order.
                         
```c#
shuffle = shuffle.Skip(26).InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Take(26));
```
Once you execute the program, you will note that the deck takes 52 iterations to reshuffle itself. Several factors contribute to this. You may address one of the key causes of this reduction in performance which is the inefficient, lazy evaluation. Note that we used a LINQ query to create the original deck. The three queries of LINQ on the previous deck are used to generate each shuffle. All of this occurs at a glacial speed. This indicates that the sequence is repeated each time it is requested. When you reach the fifty-second iteration, you will have regenerated the initial deck several times, i.e. more than once. Let's make a log to show how this works. Then you'll take care of it.
                         
Type or copy the method below into your `Extensions.cs` file. This extension method creates a new file named.log in your project directory and logs the query that is presently being running. We can use this extension method to indicate the completion of a query.
```c#
public static IEnumerable<T> LogQuery<T>
    (this IEnumerable<T> sequence, string x)
{
   
    using (var program = File.AppendText("debug.log"))
    {
        program.WriteLine($"Executing Query {x}");
    }

    return sequence;
}
```
In the above code, do not forget to add the input-output extension so that the program will execute.
```c#
using System.IO;
```
### Conclusion
In conclusion, we have got to see some working functionalities of the LINQ in C# and how to implement them in a program or solve real-life problems.
