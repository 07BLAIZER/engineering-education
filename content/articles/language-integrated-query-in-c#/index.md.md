### Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) in C#

### Introduction
The term "Language-Integrated Query" (LINQ) refers to a group of technologies that incorporate query capabilities directly into the C# programming language. Querying data has traditionally been stated as plain text, with no type checking or IntelliSense assistance at build time. It's used to access data from objects, data sets, SQL Server, and XML, among other things.
### Generating sequences with LINQ
Make sure the following three lines are at the top of the Program.cs file produced by dotnet new console before you begin. Our software will not build if these three lines are not at the top of the file.
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generics;
using System.Linq;
```
Consider what comprises a deck of cards now that you have all of the necessary references. A deck of playing cards usually comprises four suits, each with thirteen values. Normally, you'd consider starting with a Card class and manually filling a collection of Card objects. You can be more concise with LINQ than you can with the traditional method of generating a deck of cards. Instead of creating a Card class, you may build two sequences to represent suits and ranks. You'll write a pair of extremely simple iterator methods to generate the rankings and suits as `IEnumerable<T>`s of strings.
```c#
static IEnumerable<String> Suits()
{
    yield returns "diamonds";
    yield returns "hearts";
    yield returns "spades";
    yield returns "clubs";
}
static IEnumerable<string> Ranks()
{
    yield returns "two";
    yield returns "three";
    yield returns "four";
    yield returns "five"; 
    yield returns "six";
    yield returns "seven";
    yield returns "eight";
    yield returns "nine"; 
    yield returns "ten";
    yield returns "king";
    yield returns "ace";
    yield returns "jack";
    yield returns "queen";
}
```
The multiple from clauses constructs a SelectMany, which creates a single sequence by combining each element from the first and second sequences. The sequence is critical for our objectives. The first element in the first source sequence (Suits) is linked with every element in the second sequence (Ranks). As a consequence, all thirteen cards of the first suit are produced. The initial sequence's elements are all treated to the same method (Suits). The final product is a deck of cards arranged by suit, then by value.
```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var initialPart=from s in Suits()
                     from r in Ranks()
                     select new { Suit=s,Rank=r};
    foreach(var card in initialPart)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("card");
    }                 
                    
}
```
In your Program.cs file, put them after the Main method. Both of these methods use the yield return syntax to generate a sequence as they execute. The compiler creates an object that implements IEnumerableT> and generates the specified sequence of strings.
### Manipulate the order
Consider how you would mix the cards in the deck. Splitting the deck in half is the first step in any decent shuffle. This capability is provided by the LINQ APIs' Take and Skip functions. Place them beneath the `foreach loop` as shown below.
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var initialPart = from s in Suits()
                       from r in Ranks()
                       select new { Suit = s, Rank = r };

    foreach (var x in initialPart)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }
    var top = initialPart .Take(26);
    var bottom = initialPart.Skip(26);
}
```
However, the standard library does not have a shuffle method, so you'll have to develop your own. Because the shuffle method you'll be writing demonstrates various strategies that you'll use with LINQ-based programming, each step will be broken down.

To extend the functionality of how you interact with the IEnumerable returned by LINQ queries, you'll need to create extension methods. In a nutshell, an extension method is a static method with a specific purpose that adds additional functionality to an existing type without needing the original type to be changed.
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace myShuffle
{
    public static class Extensions
    {
        public static IEnumerable<T> InterleaveSequenceWith<T>(this IEnumerable<T> first, IEnumerable<T> second)
        {
            // Write your implementation here
        }
    }
}
```
### Distinguishing between eager and lazy evaluation
Lazy evaluation means that each call to the iterator only processes a single element from the source collection. Depending on the circumstances, an iterator can be a custom class, a foreach, or a while loop.
```c#
public static class Fibonacci
{
    public static IEnumerable<long> Series()
    {
        long prevX1 = 1;
        long prevX2 = 1;

        yield return prevX1;

        yield return prevX2;

        while(true)
        {
            long temp = prevX1 + prevX2;
            prevX1 = prevX2;
            prevX2 = temp;
            yield return temp;
        }
    }
}
```
Eager evaluation is the evaluation method used by most conventional programming languages. 
```c#
IEnumerable<int> myMethod()
{
    for(int i=0; i <=900; i++)
    {
        yield return I;
    }
}
...

var ex = myMethod.Take(2);
var list = ex.ToList();
```
The yield keyword allows the collection to be evaluated gradually. Eager evaluation is the process of forcing the entire collection into memory. When you call ToList, ToDictionary, or ToArray, the enumeration is evaluated immediately, and all of the elements are returned in a collection.
### Identifying places in your code where LINQ queries may have performance difficulties
The sample that we have created above performs an out shuffle, with the top and bottom cards remaining the same on every run. Let's make one alteration. instead of an out shuffle, we'll employ an in shuffle, in which all 52 cards shift positions.  As a result, the top half's final card becomes the bottom half's final card. This is a straightforward modification to a single line of code. Switch the Take and Skip locations in the current shuffle query to update it. The top and bottom half of the deck will now be in reverse order.
```c#
shuffle = shuffle.Skip(26).InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Take(26));
```
When you run the program again, you'll notice that the deck 'takes 52 iterations to reshuffle itself. This is contributed to by several factors. You may address one of the key causes of this reduction in performance which is the inefficient lazy evaluation.
Note that we used a LINQ query to create the original deck. Three LINQ queries on the previous deck are used to generate each shuffle. All of this occurs at a glacial speed. This indicates that the sequence is repeated each time it is requested. By the time you reach the 52nd iteration, you've regenerated the initial deck several times. Let's make a log to show how this works. Then you'll take care of it.


Type or copy the method below into your Extensions.cs file. This extension method creates a new file named debug.log in your project directory and logs the query that is presently being run. This extension method can be used to indicate the completion of a query.
```c#
public static IEnumerable<T> LogQuery<T>
    (this IEnumerable<T> sequence, string tag)
{
   
    using (var writer = File.AppendText("debug.log"))
    {
        writer.WriteLine($"Executing Query {tag}");
    }

    return sequence;
}
```
In the above code, do not forget to add the input-output extension so that the program will execute.
```c#
using System.IO;
```

### Conclusion
In conclusion, we have got to see some working functionalities of the LINQ in C# and how they are implemented in say a program or solving some real-life problems.
