For a data packet to be appropriately transmitted on a network, it needs to be converted into the best and most reliable way of transmission. For this reason, data is encoded in a way that is best understood by computers.

Data encoding is the conversion of data into digital signals i.e. zeros and ones.

This article intends to cover how data to be transmitted on a network is encoded. It will emphasize more on the different data encoding techniques. It will also talk about digital and analog data.

The different data encoding techniques that shall be focused on include; Non-Return to Zero Level, Non-Return to Zero, Non-Return to Zero Inverted, Bi-phase encoding, and Block encoding.

For data to be encoded, it has to be converted to signal variations.

These signal variations include:
1. Analog data to analog signal conversion â€“ This includes; Amplitude Modulation, Phase Modulation, and Frequency Modulation.
2. Digital data to analog signals - This include; Amplitude Shift Keying, frequency Shift Keying, Phase Shift Keying.
3. Digital data to digital signals - This is what we will focus on.

The types of encoding techniques include:
1. Non-Return to Zero
2. Bi-phase encoding
3. Block encoding

### Non-Return to Zero
In Non-Return to Zero encoding technique, high voltages are represented by 1s and low voltages represent 0s. Voltages remain the same during bit intervals.

There is no indication for the beginning and the ending of a bit. Due to no voltage change during bit interval, there is no difference in the previous and present bit value.

The above diagram shows the NRZ encoding technique. The main disadvantage of NRZ is that the long voltage level causes the loss of clock synchronization, and hence the receiver cannot differentiate between 0s and 1s.

The two types of NRZ encoding include;
- Non-Return to Zero level
- Non-Return to Zero Inverted

#### Non-Return to Zero Level (NRZ-L)
If the incoming signal changes from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1, the polarity changes. The first input signal should always have a polarity change.

#### Non-Return to Zero Inverted
If the input current is a 1, there is a progression just at the starting of the bit interval. The main disadvantage of the NRZ encoding is that there is a disturbance in clock synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver clock.

### Bi-phase encoding
Bi-phase encoding involves double-checking of the signal. Signals are checked at the beginning and in the middle. Due to double-checking of the signal, the clock rate is twice the rate of data transfer.

The clock synchronization is taken from the signal; hence it requires a greater bandwidth. The two types of Bi-phase encoding are Differential Manchester and Bi-phase Manchester.

#### Differential Manchester
In Differential Manchester, a transition occurs in the middle of the bit interval. Where a change occurs at the start of a bit interval, it is an indication that the input signal was 0 unless otherwise.

#### Bi-phase Manchester
Here, a transition is done in the middle of the bit interval. The resultant pulse of the transition is from high to low when input is 1 in the middle and vice versa for input 0.

NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Biphase Manchester, and Differential Manchester coding waveforms for different digital inputs are shown in the image below.

### Block encoding
For clock synchronization to be achieved, redundancy is needed for error detecting. This redundancy can be achieved by block encoding to improve performance. This type of encoding changes a block of x bits into a block of y bits in which the y bits are more significant than the x bits. Referred to as xB/yB encoding. This involves typically three steps i.e

Division - In this step, a group of bits is divided into x bits. 

Substitution - This is the main step; x bits are substituted for the y bit group.

Combination - Here, the y bit groups are combined to form a stream. The newly formed stream has more bits than the original bits; hence more data is sent.

The two types of block encoding are; 4B/5B and 8B/6T encoding techniques.

#### 4B/5B encoding technique
Like in Manchester encoding, clocks with double speed are required to send data.

In this type of encoding, double speed clocks are not required. Instead, 4 bits of codes are mapped to 5 bits having a minimum of 1-bit in the group.

Double speed clocks are avoided by assigning 5 bits in place of 4 consecutive bits, which are pre-determined in a dictionary. When choosing a 5-bit code, there should be just one leading 0 and no more than two trailing 0s.

Hence, transmission occurs as a block of bit.

#### 8B/6T encoding technique
Two voltages have been used to send data in the previously described encoding techniques, but what if we use more voltages like 3 volts or more? Can we send more data? The answer is yes.

For example, if we use 6 volts levels to represent 8 bits for a single signal, we term the type of encoding as 8B/6T encoding.

This means that we can have as many as 15625 i.e 5<sup>6</sup> combinations and 65536 i.e 4<sup>8</sup> and combinations for bits.

### Pros
From this article, we learn that when Block encoding is used to encode data, more bits are sent on a network; hence it is more reliable.
Block encoding is also more efficient since no double clocks are needed to send data; hence, there are no effects of poor clock synchronization.

### Cons
As discussed above, in Non-Return to Zero encoding, we realize that NRZ encoding is not a better way of encoding data for transmission due to lack of clock synchronization; hence the receiver might get a wrong message.

For reliable transmission, digital data is typically converted into digital signals using the techniques that we've studied so far.

### Conclusion
This article enlightens readers to understand better Bi-phase encoding, Block encoding, and Non-Return to zero encodings.

The reader should understand the different types of Bi-phase encoding, both differential Manchester and Bi-phase Manchester, and encode a message in both types.

The reader should be able to know the demerits of the Non-return to zero encodings and know a good method to encode a message for transmission i.e, Block encoding,
