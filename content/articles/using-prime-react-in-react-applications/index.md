### How to create a responsive React navigation bar using PrimeReact
React is all about components, these helps us to reuse our JavaScript code over and over. It also maintains and update the page.
React is used to build single page application and user interface.
 
### Introduction
PrimeReact is like CSS, which is used in styling the user interface of our application.
But unlike CSS, PrimeReact has pre-defined style in each components, which we can use in our React application.

### Prerequisites
For this tutorial:
- Basic knowledge of React.js
- Little knowledge on npm
- Have visual studio code and npm installed, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download visual studio code

### Goal
To create a responsive navigation bar using Prime React components in a React.js application.
To use PrimeReact components in our project.

Let's start coding.

### What is PrimeReact:
PrimeReact is a UI components for React application.
PrimeReact has different components for themes, styles and icons which we can import and use in our React application.
It is a free open source library.

#### Step 1 - Create React application
When creating React application, we first go to the folder we want our application to exist.
To create a React application type following command in a terminal or cmd.
`npx create-react-app my-prime`

After installing, type `cd my-prime` to go into my-prime folder.
Type `npm start` to start the development server. The React website can be seen on `http://localhost:3000/` in your system browser.

#### Step 2 - Adding PrimeReact dependencies
In order to add PrimeReact dependencies into our project, we first open the terminal of our visual studio code. Ensure that the terminal is accessing my-prime folder

Input `npm install primereact --save` and press "enter" to install prime react
then `npm install primeicons --save` also press "enter" to install primeicons.

PrimeReact components need PrimeIcons library for icons and react-transition-group for animations.

Type  `npm install react-transition-group` and press "enter" to install react-transition-group.

If the dependencies we installed are shown in the package.json file then our installation was successful. 
As shown below

```JSON
"dependencies": {
    "primeicons": "^4.1.0",
    "primereact": "^6.6.0",
    "react-transition-group": "^4.4.2"
  },
```

#### Step - 3 Modifying our React application
When we create a react project, react has some pre-defined codes we need to modify. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, A website showing React logo will be displayed. Let's modify the website codes. Open app.js file in your visual studio code editor, then remove all code within the div tag except `import './App.css'`. 

```javascript
import React from 'react'; //for React
import './App.css' // for CSS

function App() {
  return (
    <div className = "App">
      
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
We then import our prime react themes and icons

```javascript
import "primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css";
import "primereact/resources/primereact.min.css";
import "primeicons/primeicons.css";
```

The above should be added at the top of the app.js file to enable primereact icons, theme and styles be effective in our browser.

Our app.js file should look like this below

```javascript
import './App.css';
import "primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css";
import "primereact/resources/primereact.min.css";
import "primeicons/primeicons.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* code goes here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Step 4 - Creating a Nav component
We first need to create a component and import it into our app.js. 
For example, within the src folder, letâ€™s create a separate folder called component, where we will store our Navigation code. 
Within the component folder, we create a new file and name it Nav.js. 
We then create a React function called Navigation, within the return parentheses we create a nav bar for our browser using HTML elements like div tag, header tag, nav tag and ul tag.

```javascript
const Navigation = () => {
    return(
        <div>
           <header>
              <nav>
                <h1>Prime React</h1>
                 <ul></ul>
              </nav>
           </header>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Navigation;
```

After this our Navigation function should be imported inside our app.js file, within the div of our app.js we add our Navigation function so as to make our Navigation code display on the browser

`import Navigation from './component/Nav';` This should be at the top of our app.js file.

Within the div tag of our app.js file we add our Navigation element

```javascript
<div classname="App"> 
 <Navigation />
</div>. 
```

Css styles can be added to change the pre-defined styles.

#### Step 5 - Making our Navigation Bar responsive 
To add PrimeReact components to our project, we first need to import them into our project. We will be using some prime react components such as Menubar, ProgressBar and Button components in this tutorial.

To use Menubar component, we import it inside our Nav.js file inside our component folder, then add it within our nav tag HTML element to make it display within our Navigation 

```javascript
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';
import { Menubar } from 'primereact/menubar';
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext';s
```

The above should be added at the top of our Nav.js file, within our Navigation function we then create a const variable called list that will store an array of label and icons.
This is shown below 
 
 ```javascript
 const list = [
        {label: 'Home', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home'},
        {label: 'About', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-calendar'},
        {label: 'Contact', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file'},
        {label: 'Log In', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog'}
    ]
```

Then we add Menubar, Button and InputText component within our nav tag inside our return React function. 

Our Nav.js file should look like this

```javascript
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';
import { Menubar } from 'primereact/menubar';
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext'
import './Nav.css'

const Navigation = () => {
     const list = [
        {label: 'Home', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home'},
        {label: 'About', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-calendar'},
        {label: 'Contact', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file'},
        {label: 'Log In', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog'}
    ];
    return(
        <div className='navigation'>
            <header>
                <h1>Prime React</h1>
                 <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><Menubar
                            model={list}
                            start={<InputText placeholder="Search" type="text"/>}
                            end={<Button label="PrimeReact" icon="pi "/>}
                        /></li>    
                       
                    </ul>
                </nav>
            </header>
           
        </div>
    )
}
export default Navigation;
```
The list variable will store what will be displayed on our Navigation bar. 

> To know more about Menubar components from [here](https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/menubar)

In the div tag we added a className and gave it the value navigation (we can call the value anything we want). The className value will serve as a link to our external css style sheet, we must create a css file called Nav.css to store our external css styles then import Nav.css in our component so as to make the styles work in our application.   
The above code makes our Navigation bar responsive on all device screen size.
We can change the style or theme of our PrimeReact components if it's not styled . You can read more about Prime React theme from [here](https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/theming)

Our App.js file should look like this below

```javascript
import './App.css';
import "primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css";
import "primereact/resources/primereact.min.css";
import "primeicons/primeicons.css";
import Navigation from './component/Nav';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      < Navigation />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
