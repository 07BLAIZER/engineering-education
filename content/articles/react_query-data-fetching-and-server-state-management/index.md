[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a powerful client-side JavaScript library. One of the complicated aspects to handle is state management. This gets even more convoluted when dealing with server state. Server state is a bit different as it is asynchronous and persisted remotely. This means that we have to think about updating, caching, or re-fetching data to efficiently manage the state in our React applications. [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is a pre-configured library that aims to solve this complexities. Using React Query, we can fetch, cache, and update data in React-based applications in a declarative and simple manner without touching any global state.
