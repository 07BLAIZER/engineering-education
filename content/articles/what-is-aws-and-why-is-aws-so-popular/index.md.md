AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon, the tech giant. AWS provided cloud computing and APIs services on-demand for organizations to run and host online infrastructures and applications. It offers a wide variety of computing powers, databases, storage, content delivery platforms, networking, virtualization, analytics, security, and many services that easily scale and available across businesses and organizations of all levels.

### A brief history of AWS and how it came to be

ASW was first launched in 2002 internally by Amazon to provide tools to developers to incorporate cloud features into the Amazon.com website.

In 2003 the idea of selling the servers as a service in the cloud was first formulated by AWS.

In 2004 The first AWS service was launched to the public. The service was called Simple Queuing Service (SQS). It provided just simple queue services.

In 2006, AWS officially launched its first cloud services with three main service segments. These are SQS, S3 (Simple Storage Service), and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). In 2007 AWS had about 180 000 developers on their platform. It is worth noting that in 2008 some major AWS competitors entered the cloud service provider market. These were Microsoft and Google.

In 2009, AWS introduced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to its infrastructure. This was a significant breakthrough for AWS. The main goal of VPC is to partition and rent AWS private data centers to customers.

In 2012 AWS launched the first reinvent called AWS Developer Conference, a yearly largest technological event globally, where AWS talks about its services and products. The same year AWS introduces Redshift, Amazon's petabyte-scale data warehousing service.

In 2013, AWS saw one of its major breakthroughs, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), moved its infrastructure to AWS. This was a huge success. In 2015, AWS released its profit figure to the public, with a record of 4.6 billion for the previous year (2014), with an expected growth of about 49% (that is 6.2 billion) in 2015. And in 2016, AWS surpassed its 10 billion revenue target.

Today, AWS has a ton of services and certifications. There is a massive demand for AWS services these days. The AWS cloud service platform is now estimated to be used by more than 45% of the global market. An average of 1 of the 3 website you visit uses AWS services.

### A recap of cloud service

Think of a personal use case of a cloud service. Just like iCloud and Dropbox, AWS is a cloud service provider. In the past, you may have used cloud computing to store pictures, videos, and documents. However, that is only a very small subset of what cloud computing is. The cloud is different from what has been used in the past.

When storing this personal data on your home hard drive, there's always the risk that your hard drive will fail. In this case, you use a cloud service provider such as AWS to store the personal file. You use the cloud for backup, so there is always another copy of your files. Sharing a copy of this file becomes more accessible. By sharing means, you can access the same files across different devices such as your mobile device or your work computer. Your files are available and accessible on any device.

In this scenario, you have the following main cloud advantage.

- High availability - if you put a file up into the cloud, you make it highly available. You can access it from any device or any computer as long as it has internet connections.

- Fault tolerance - if you have a file only on your home computer and the hard drive fails, your data is lost. Moreover, your Home computer system will not account for that fault being the fault of your hard drive. However, if the file is up in the cloud, it is backed up on multiple services. If the file becomes corrupt for the cloud server, there will always be another copy for you to access. If there's a fault in the system, you will still always have the ability to retrieve that file because there are backups and other ways to access it

### How AWS Works as a cloud service provider

Think of an enterprise company that is not using cloud services such as AW. This means the company has on-premise data centers and servers for handling and storing their data. When a customer wants to access the company's software or a service, they're accessing resources on the company's on-premise servers.

Let's say in 2019, about 3000 users accessed this software, so the company has three severs to power up its software to these users. When the number of user base grows in the next year, let's say to 6000. The three servers the company has will not be enough to handle that significant number of additional users. The company will be required to add a cost and space to double the number of servers on its on-premise data center to handle the load of having more users. In this case, they have to research what type of servers they need, make an order, wait for delivery, set them up, install operating systems software, test them and get them all up and running.

Now the servers are currently working for them in the user base that they have. The company has to set and upgrade its date center as the company grows and becomes more popular to handle the increasing user base numbers (customer). And the same process of making sure the space is available, ordering, and setting the server up and running repeats itself. This will always force the company to spend tens of thousands of dollars on these high-end servers.

Now take a scenario where the company projected an increase of its user base 2021 to 25000 and set its data center to handle this traffic. But ended up getting 15000 users. This means that the servers that they just purchased aren't being used. This is a tremendous waste of resources and money for something that is not being used. They didn't get enough users to back up this huge investment. They would have to sell the servers or just let them sit there until the user base increases. And if such user base projections won't work in the feature, this will always be a major loss.

This is the biggest problem that clouds computing providers, such as AWS, solve. The company no longer has to project or estimate future growth naturally to set a number of servers. As the user base grows, AWS can automatically and instantly add additional servers and resources according to the number of users accessing the company's services. AWS will automatically upgrade functionality and features for you to handle the current user base traffic within no time.

This time, the company doesn't need on-premise data centers and servers. A process that would take several weeks can now be done in a matter of minutes using a cloud service provider like AWS.

When you use AWS cloud, you only use services on demand. AWS offers a self-service platform that uses pricing models that effectively estimate the costs of running your specific project according to the need of resources your project or application needs. At the end of the day, you only pay for what you use. Thus no large upfront capital investment and procurement cycle and maintaining dedicated servers and hardware to meet needs on the changes in the market.

AWS gives some major advantages such as;

- Scalability - as the number of users increases, you have the ability to easily and quickly scale up the number of serves your users need on demand.

- Elasticity - your server can grow or shrink. As the users increase and demand more resources, you can easily grow your dedicated server network. And if the number of users goes down, you can quickly shrink and pull back the server's resources depending on the resources demand.

- Low cost - it offers better pricing. AWS services are cost-effective. Besides, you only pay what you use with pay as you go pricing without upfront costs and commitments. You improve your application performance without having to invest in a new server. You just scale down or upscale capacity depending on the users visiting or accessing the application.
