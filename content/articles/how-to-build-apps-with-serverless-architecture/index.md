### Introduction
A company considering building a serverless application has to re-adapt to the specifics of [cloud architecture](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture).

This article will look at developing the frontend and backend of applications in the serverless architecture model, explain its benefits and limitations, and look at the best examples of the same in the market.

### What is Serverless Architecture?
Serverless refers to designing and deploying applications without the development team dealing with the basic server infrastructure. The server is managed and maintained by trusted third-party companies.

With the serverless approach, a company does not need to worry about the application's backend since it is already outsourced. It only has to deal with the frontend of the application as their primary concern.

### Backend As A Service (BaaS)
The serverless backend design depends on how the company acquires the service. The company pays a third-party vendor to deal with the application’s inner logic. It deals with the storage of information, devices, security, and backend. As the platform auto-generates the backend, much time is saved on development and testing.

Most providers use a flexible per-use model, meaning that the company is charged based on use and processing power and not for a specific timeframe. If more server space is needed, the platform modifies the subscribed plan automatically.

### Functions As A Service (FaaS)
In a serverless model, the FaaS functions acts as the frontend of the application. The functionality is divided into several functions that run independently.

Each function executes once a trigger action is received from the application’s user. An application will then respond to the trigger action. As a result, the functions start running. The cloud service providers limit a function in terms of runtime and size. The function stops running once an event that triggered it is cancelled. The application is sensitive about its memory usage, and this results in low computing costs.

### Can Serverless Architecture used for building mobile applications
Most cloud platforms have dedicated environments for serverless mobile application development. For example, AWS has a feature called [Cloud Mobile Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/compute/build-serverless-applications-in-aws-mobile-hub/) which its purpose is to connect mobile functionality and interfaces to [AWS serverless platform](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

The notable difference between the use of on-premise infrastructure and serverless design is that the backend resides in the cloud. It would mean that developers have to build the frontend functions that listen to the client-made triggers. Flexible applications on serverless architecture are fast, dependable, and lightweight.

### Advantages of Serverless Architecture for application development
Companies using the [monolithic approach](https://medium.com/koderlabs/introduction-to-monolithic-architecture-and-microservices-architecture) in their application development back in the day are now switching to serverless to decentralize their functionality.

The major reason is its efficiency and lower subscription costs. The other advantages developers get with going the serverless way are as follows:

- **Simple structure**: Serverless comes with ready-made templates that can be used for frontend function development. It means that the developer only needs to copy-paste the code into a predefined framework. Also, a developer needs not set up the application's business logic or write the backend.
- **Lower costs**: With serverless platforms, the company only pays for the used storage and computing resources and not the specified timeframe. It translates to reduced costs for the company.
- **Scalability**:** Application development using a serverless approach is very flexible. The developer has to edit a single function to make a change in the application. It results in fast development and more accessible updates.
- **Functionality focus**: As the developers are not involved with hardware, data processing, or even internal business logic, they can shift their focus on the main functionality of the application. It leads to the high quality of product and responsiveness.

### How Serverless Application Model works?
A serverless application consists of a combination of functions built to work together at the same time. It includes APIs, event source mappings, and databases.

- **Template specification**: specifies the application's syntax, events, permissions, and settings. Developers can opt to use a ready-made template and customize it to fit the application's purpose and functionality. Examples are [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/serverless) and [SAM by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification.html).
- **The command line**: with customized command-line tools, the developers can execute the commands in the CLI to debug code, call functions, modify the template files, create and sort packages.

### Choosing a Cloud provider
In serverless development, the choice of cloud provider dramatically contributes to the success of a given project. Currently, there are several cloud providers regarded as market leaders, as highlighted below:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is regarded as a market leader in the provision of cloud infrastructure with excellent serverless development tools. It provides AWS Lambda that natively supports Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, Golang, and C#.
- **Google app development platform** is popular for supporting startups with better pricing hence reducing computing costs. Google Functions support different languages such as Java, Python, Node.js, and Go.
- **IBM** – It is commonly used for enterprises and supports C and C++ as its primary languages.

### Serverless Deployment
Serverless architecture development allows the developers to deploy the whole project by use of functions and packages. Also, all platforms use varying tools to deploy different sizes of applications.

Every cloud provider offers different strategies for deploying serverless functions, and developers should look at the one that fits their projects' needs to make informed decisions.

### Infrastructural limits
Different cloud providers have different limits, such as maximum runtime, storage space, processing speed, and power. Below are the limits of different known cloud providers:

- **AWS Lambda** – According to their official documentation, they offer maximum storage space, specific memory allocation, runtime restrictions, and CPU availability.
- **Google Functions –** It limits the maximum number of revisions, servers, and container instances. It also limits the number of processed SSL certificates.
- **IBM** also has limitations on used memory, CPU, and a maximum number of processed requests.

It is up to the developer to follow the official documentation of the preferred cloud solutions vendor and get more insights into their capabilities and restrictions.

### Scalability
Serverless architecture is natively highly scalable; however, the different cloud providers have strategies that enable software growth.

Each cloud vendor in most of the time, offers auto-scaling of serverless functions. For instance, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) comes with [algorithm-based function scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-scaling.html) depending on one project's requirements.

Google, on the other hand, comes with many services for application scaling. It also offers multiple scaling options, meaning that Google has a rich [ecosystem](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/6-strategies-for-scaling-your-serverless-applications) supporting those needs if the project requires it.

IBM also supports automated scaling, but their approach may be different. The developer interested in IBM can go through their official documentation to find out all their infrastructure limitations for auto-scaling algorithms.

### Development
When building a serverless architecture, developers must set the events and triggers and know how the users will interact with the application.

They also need to predict and see different events and how to come up with appropriate responses.

Developing the application has to follow the best frontend development practices. The main issue with the developers and the Quality Assurance (QA) team is that they cannot run the features locally. Most cloud provider process one function after another on the local storage. The only solution to the above problem is to download a different environment that bypasses that restriction.

During the development process, developers should include [serverless security tools](https://blog.techmagic.co/top-10-serverless-monitoring-tools/) to have more visibility and predict future technical issues with their applications.

### Examples of Serverless Applications
Below are some of the examples of companies that utilized FaaS in their serverless application development:

#### Royal Dutch Shell
The company previously had a mobile application that could not easily integrate with complex analytics. It also never accommodated the required number of users and had poor data handling. They needed a total application redesign to improve security.

They arrived at they had to switch Amazon Cloud infrastructure for serverless application development with Node.js. Now, the company adopted many Amazon instances to allow for complex functionality. It has also integrated third-party security components.

#### UPS
UPS decided to utilize a serverless approach and cloud-based infrastructure to improve their chatbot.

The organization required an AI partner that would handle customers' requests, consult and updates the team. To boost the performance of the whole system, the organization decided to use Microsoft Azure.

Azure cloud and serverless development gave the company a ready-made infrastructure. They outsourced their backend to Microsoft and only had to deal with client-side functionality making it more reliable and intuitive.

#### T-Mobile
The communication company decided to switch its platform to AWS Lambda for web and mobile development. Their platforms used to process massive amounts of sensitive data and had to be highly scalable.

The change to serverless application development was not easy. Apart from coding, the organization had to do data migration, documentation, and API integration.

### Conclusion
Moving the serverless way is most beneficial to established organizations and also new businesses. It significantly reduces costs, improves on quality, shortens time to market, and spotlights on advancement.

The organization will also benefit from the pool of ready to use development tools, API integration automation extensions, and on-demand scaling. Any company that wants to get ahead with serverless technology should hire the right serverless development team and enjoy the technology successes.
