The World wide web is a crucial element of our modern life. It has become part of us, and it would not be easy to outgrow our lives without it. This is because technology has greatly advanced as people can efficiently work remotely and easily communicate with the help of the internet. The reliance on the world wide web has grown in the last three decades and has gone through stages of evolution from [Web 1.O](https://websitebuilders.com/how-to/glossary/web1/), [Web 2.O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0), and [Web 3.O](https://web3.foundation/).

Most people are probably wondering what the future web will be like. Well, Web 3.O (Web 3) is the future web. Many people are confused about what the next generation internet (Web 3) will be like. Web 3 is a part of a much larger phase of transition that we will go through. Therefore, there is a more significant change going on right now on the internet, and lots of improvements are being deployed.

The internet just got a lot more complicated. There's an increased awareness of web 3, and there is so much jargon in the space, and it isn't easy to understand what it's all about. This article will break down all the jargon for you and make you perfectly understand what web 3.O is all about.

This article will explain Web 3 or the future of the web. If you want to stay up-to-date on how we'll change our lives soon, make sure you read this article to get the complete picture. Without further ado, let's get started.

### The Evolution of the Web
The internet and web technology have certainly evolved in the past few years. The world wide web has evolved through different phases: Web 1.O, Web 2.O, and Web 3.O. Each phase has brought about new technologies, tools, and techniques relevant to recruiters.

Let's dive deeper to find out how the internet evolved from its initiation to what we know it as today.

#### What is Web 1.O
Web 1.O was the first phase of the web revolution, also referred to as read-only web. It is primarily categorized by static websites that don't do much but display information on the page. You can read text, click different links, and write and send emails but can't attach or upload images and documents.

Web 1.O was a content delivery network (CDN) that showcased information on websites. People mainly used it in the year 1990 to 2005. It had a small number of creators but a vast amount of consumers.

#### What is Web 2.O
Web 2.O is the interactive version of 1.0 since you can read and write on the internet as well. There are many content creators in Web 2.O since we have Youtube, Google, Microsoft, and social media applications.

Therefore, everyone has the power to share content on the internet. The ability to read and write has increased the value of the internet drastically. People are using the internet via their smartphones, ipads, and laptops. 

In Web 2.O internet begins to be a big part of everyone's life, but at the same time, it also highlights the flaws of 2.0. As technology is growing, we care more about our privacy and how to protect our data. We have serious concerns over censorship and centralization.

Applications like Google, Amazon, and social media corporations have your data, and they can use it as they want. They have the right and power to control who's allowed or use their platforms or what you should see. In Web 2.O there are intermediaries such that if you have to send a message, you have to do it via social media platforms, i.e., WhatsApp or Facebook. If you have to transact, you have to do it via PayPal or bank. If you have to book a room, you have to do it via Airbnb.

All these middlemen are extracting value and collecting personal data, and it's completely unnecessary. Security is another problem that has arisen. When hackers want to hack an app, all they have to do is attack the app itself. In simple terms, we need more security and safer ways to store our data without censorship. 

This is the reason for Web 3.O emergence.

#### What is Web 3.O
Web 3.O is essentially the [decentralized web](https://harvardtechnologyreview.com/2021/08/22/the-dawn-of-a-new-decentralized-internet/), where the power that was once held by Web 2.O corporations is being transferred to the people.

Web 3.O is internet [powered by blockchains](https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-decentralized-web-internet-web3-4ce5aa68ccc6). The internet that wasn't possible before all the benefits that blockchain provides like decentralization, trust minimization, and power to control data. [Tim Berners-Lee](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/), the World Wide Web inventor, predicted that this phase of the internet is called [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), which would be more open, smarter, and more sovereign.

Blockchain technology is changing how we interact with the internet by changing our data structures. The emergence of blockchain means we will be able to build Web 3 in a way that works for everyone. Web 3 mainly focuses on connecting data in a decentralized way rather than storing it in centralized systems. So using these decentralized platforms will give users more control over their data, privacy, and security.

The shift toward Web 3 will enable the internet of value and open up so many possibilities for what we can do with the internet. Web 3 will bring a fairer internet by allowing individuals to interact with the system without passing through intermediaries. Users and machines will be able to connect more seamlessly with data. This means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a significant role in making this phase of the internet more intelligent and powerful to process information.

### Why we need Web 3
Web 3 will be an updated version of Web 2. It will resolve multiple problems with the internet we use today and will bring additional benefits. Web 3 will bring:

#### Decentralization
Decentralization means that instead of storing your data in a central server, it's saved on individual nodes. There are decentralized nodes, and your data is distributed on those nodes. No one knows in which node you have your data, and it's safe.

There is the blockchain concept because nodes connect one another, and the significant advantage is that blockchain is secure. Therefore with blockchain, your data is safe.

Looking at companies that control the internet, i.e., Google and Microsoft, all traffic goes through them, they have the most money, have all the data, they have all resources. The question is, how do you compete with them? The answer is decentralized systems.

#### Money value
Web 2 has brought about a shrinking economy as all these giant companies are earning a lot from our data. Web 3 will bring economic value as digital creators will make money from their data like never before.

People spend hours online each day. It would be a good deal if we made money from the data we create while spending hours and hours online. But unfortunately, this is not the case in the current version of the internet. Since Web 3 is built on the blockchain, [cryptocurrency](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/cryptocurrency-7-things-to-know) and [decentralized finance (DEFI)](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/) will help create a form of money native to the internet.

#### Data ownership
In Web 2, data generated by users is controlled, managed, and used by giant tech companies. With Web 3 that is powered by blockchains, users will get complete ownership of their data. [PRIVI](https://priviprotocol.io/), a Web 3 system, aims to return data ownership to the right owner. Also, it makes it possible for anyone to control and monetize their data.

People will have the power to decide the information they want to share with organizations and advertising agencies. Also, they will get an opportunity to earn from it.

#### High Security
Web 3.O will be a lot more secure than the earlier versions of the internet. Because it's powered by blockchain, it's considered immutable and secure. Therefore, it will be impossible for hackers to penetrate the network without being caught.

#### Artificial intelligence (AI)
The future web will bring innovations in areas of intelligence, automation, and robotics. It will therefore solve more problems. In the current internet, humans control everything about [AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-ai). But how can we let this AI make decisions and learn by itself in a way that humans do not control?

To let it free and make its own decisions, we'll need a decentralized service that no one controls. Combining this capability with natural language processing (NLP), computers can easily understand information like humans, thus providing faster and more relevant results. They become more intelligent to satisfy people's needs.

#### Permissionless blockchain
Web 3 will remove control of the web from the centralized authorities that currently dominate it. Anybody will be able to join the network and take part in it. Permissionless blockchain will make it possible to access information presented in a more beneficial way to users.

Characteristics of permissionless blockchains include:
+ Openness and transparency of transactions
+ Lack of a central authority
+ Open source development
+ Massive use of tokens and digital assets as incentives to participate.

### How blockchain works
Blockchain is a linked list. A linked list is a way to store data, and it is an immutable data structure. Therefore a blockchain is an immutable linked list meaning you cannot change the values once they are recorded in a blockchain. Blockchain is made of blocks linked together, and inside of these blocks, we store data. The data is in the form of transactions.

Each block is made of data, the block's hash, and the previous block's hash. The hash identifies the block and all its contents. The previous block's hash creates a chain of blocks, and it's this technique that makes blockchain so secure.

### Blockchain to make Web 3 possible
Blockchain technology is a decentralized system that handles peer-to-peer networking and keeps track of transactions and data in chains. It uses a cryptographic hash that connects the blocks in a chain. Thus making the records immutable and providing a stable data structure.

Blockchain technology serves as the foundation of WEb 3. It adds enormous value to Web 3, and it'll by fixing many Web 2.O flaws. In simple terms, blockchain is the steering force behind Web 3, allowing formerly impossible tasks to be achieved. 

Utilizing blockchain technology of decentralized nodes makes it possible to store data securely, thus enhancing privacy. With data decentralization, personal information will not be stored in databases and data centers of organizations or centralized entities. Preferably intelligent contracts can be employed that eliminate the requirement for intermediaries to be involved.

### Conclusion
Web 3 will change our lives by bringing an internet of value and developments. These developments will only be possible with blockchain technology, which serves as the basis of this next-generation internet. The field of digital technology is growing very fast, and very soon, Web 3.O will be here.
