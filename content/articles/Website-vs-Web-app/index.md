description: In this article, we are going to look at the differences between Web page and a Website in backend development. It is difficult for a user to distinguish between a website and a web application. They enter the URL and get the expected outcomes.Getting the results of what they are searching for is what matters to the end-user. How they get the results is not their business.

### Introduction
It is difficult for most people to distinguish between a website and a web application. They enter the URL and get the expected outcomes, making them unaware of the backend processes.
These products are created for the consumer by developers. Therefore, a developer must be able to tell the difference between the two. 
Some developers argue that the terms `website` and `web application` are similar, while others say they are not. Who is wrong, and who is correct?ðŸ˜•
I was once among those who argued that the two terms mean the same, but after research, I found out that these are two different things. 
In this article, I will highlight some of the main differences that have helped me understand the differences between websites and web applications.

In this tutorial, we will look at:
1. [Website](#website)
2. [Web application](#web-application)
3. [Distinctions between a website and a web application](#distinctions-between-a-website-and-a-web-application)

### Website

A website is a collection of interconnected pages that may contain images, audio, or video and are linked by a single domain name.

Examples of websites include:

1. Dating websites

2. Educational Websites

3. Social Media websites

4. Portfolio website

#### Characteristics of a Website
A good website developer can examine a site according to its features. One of the characteristics that will determine the success of a website is its appearance. Let's have a look at some additional website attributes.
1. `User friendly`: A website should be easy to operate.
2. `Attractive and accessible for all targeted users`:This helps attract users to opt for a particular website against another. 
3. ``Reliable``-A good website should be accessed by an end user anytime and anywhere. It should work for 24 hours a day and it should be trustworthy. It should also deriver notifications in good time to keep the user updated.
4. `High speed of loading`: Web developers should consider this feature as not all end-users are patient. Therefore if a website loads slowly, a user will most likely look for a different website with a high speed. There numerous elements that contribute to the loading speed of a website. The most crucial being the hosting quality. Therefore, always choose a host that loads fast.
5. `Secure`- A good website should provide security for both end-users and the website developers.

#### Importance of a website

1. ``Updates to customers``- As your website is available 24/7, updates and notices can be easily published for your customers. This is a way to keep them up-to-date on all you do. When something matters particularly to you, you are more likely to upsell it.

2. `Professionalism` - Studies show that most people opt to deal with businesses with websites compared to those that lack one. 

3. ``Creates a large market pool``- Your business accessibility is exponentially increasing through a website, as it is accessible from anywhere in the world. Websites therefore help companies to break geographical obstacles and increase sales significantly.
4. ``Growth Opportunity``- A website may serve as a portfolio of a company or resume. This can prove to be beneficial for companies as the site can act as a reference for potential investors who know what you have achieved already and your plans for the future as a company.

### Web application
A web application is a program that can be accessed via a browser and is linked to a database. A web application contains both functional and interactive elements.
Unlike websites, web apps are more complex to create (because they are very customized) and require an experienced team.
Below are examples of web application:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

#### Characteristics of A web Application
1. `Accessibility`: A good web app should available and usable by as many people as possible.
2. `Storage system` -A web app should have a good and reliable database for storing the developers' and end-users information.
3. ``Easy to update``- Business keeps on expanding as time passes by. Therefore a web app should be simple to update.
4. `Cross-platform`- A web app should be able to run on most if not all operating systems using different browsers.

#### Importance of a Web Application

1. `Security`: Web applications ensure sites and programs are secure since they are designed with more privacy and a high level of protection.
 2. `Easy to use`: End users can access them from any device at any time. 

3.  Data access is simple because they are used on both mobile and desktop computers. 

### Distinctions between a website and a web application

#### 1. The user's interaction
There is no functionality on the website. The end-user only views the visual content but cannot interact with it.
On the other hand, a web app allows the end-user to interact one-on-one with the content on the application.
#### 2. Reasons for creation
A website is mostly meant for the universe, which means information can be accessed by anyone publicly.
Unlike a website, the web app is meant for interaction with a particular end-users, which means that the end-user must provide some details to use a web app. Without the required information, data might not be available.
#### 3. Code Deployment
On a website, small changes do not require full re-accumulation and deployment. You need to refresh/update the HTML code.
Code deployment in the web app is quite different. Here, you need to re-compile and re-deploy the app after making any change.
#### 4. Authentication
On a website, end-users authentication is not mandatory. The user may give some details at wish if they are willing to get any updates from the website.
On the other hand, Web applications need validation as they offer more extensive alternatives and usefulness than a website. To access your account, a user must provide details like username and password that verify ownership.
#### 5. Development
Developing a website is not complicated. With the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript, you can create a working website. Sometimes it only requires a single frontend developer to do the task.
Furthermore, you can use a template to develop a website. 
For a web app, development is quite different from that of a website. Here, you need the knowledge of both frontend and backend to develop a working web app. For the backend part, there is a variety of technologies to be used. Either Python, PHP, Ruby, etc. Choosing the backend technology depends on the developer. 
#### 6. Task and Complexity

While a website shows the collected information and data on a particular page, a web app is quite complicated and functions higher compared to the website.

### Conclusion
Unlike developing a website that is a bit simple and less complicated, creating a web application needs more knowledge and experience.
From the above discussion, I believe that you can tell the difference between website and web app and what you interact with daily.
