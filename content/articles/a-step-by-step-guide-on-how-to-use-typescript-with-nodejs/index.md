Typescript, a JavaScript superset, is gaining tremendous popularity among developers. It incorporates every JavaScript feature with supplementary traits such as static typing, IntelliSense, and type checking.

Many factors make Node.js a popular JavaScript framework. This includes; Node.js diverse packages. Node.js has a strong NPM (Node Package Manager) ecosystem that provides open-source code (packages) that you can use in any of your Node.js projects. Check out this fantastic article to learn more about why Node.js is a popular framework. Node.js is great for making server-side applications. It lacks some modern coding style, such as type checking. Node.js codebase can also be very hard to maintain.

Typescript supports these modern coding styles, such as static typing and type checking. It is made to build extensive and high-level applications. That's why it would be great to have Typescript as the primary language to support Node.js functionality. This allows you to write server-side-based applications with strong type checking, which allows you to avoid runtime type error and other Typescript advantages and Take full advantage of Node.js, having built your application based on the Node.js ecosystem.

To benefit from these vital Node.js features, you need to set up and configure your Typescript with Node.js runtime. This guide will teach you how to set up and run your Typescript application with Node.js and run some Node.js packages within your Typescript application.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.
- Basic [understanding of Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4).
- Basic [understanding of Typescript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI).

### Setting up Node.js

Once Node.js is installed in the computer, run `node â€“v` to confirm if the installation was successful.

Just like you would have done with any application running on the Node.js runtime, create a project folder. Open a command line and change the directory to point to this new project folder. To generate the Node.js package.json file, run `npm init`. This will introduce systematic questions about your project. Answer this prompts the way you would set up the regular Node.js project. Alternatively, run  `npm init -y` and override the `packages.json` file with the default values.

### Setting up Typescript

To set up Typescript with Node.js, you need Typescript dependencies provided by the NPM registry. To install the [Typescript compiler package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript), run the following command.

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

The above command will install the Typescript compiler globally. This means any project you create on your computer can access Typescript dependencies without reinstalling the Typescript package when building another project.

Run `tsc --version` to confirm if the compiler is installed.

> Note: Typescript code doesn't build directly on a browser (no browser will read Typescript directly). A browser will only read JavaScript code. To invoke any Typescript code, you need a compiler to transpile Typescript to browser executable JavaScript. Typescript will only help you in the development process so that you benefit from its features.

### Creating Typescript config file

To initialize the Typescript project with Node.js, create a [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html
) file in the project root directory. The config file stores the options for the Typescript compiler. Alternatively, you can run `tsc --init` to automatically create this file in whatever directory you're in.

![Generating tsconfig.json file](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/generateing-tsconfig-file.png)

This file is the Typescript configuration file. It specifies typescript compile options.

![tsconfig.json file](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/tsconfig-file.png)

The `tsconfig.json` file has many options. It's good to know when to turn things on and off. TSC reads this file and uses these options to transpile Typescript into Brower readable JavaScript.

Let's edit this config file to include the necessary option for running Typescript.

- `"target": "es6"` - one key thing you need to define is the version of ECMAScript of JavaScript version that the compiler will output. If you need more advanced ECMAScript features, such as using the arrow function, `const`, and `let`, you can choose to use ES6 or a higher version. The target option allows you to use and follow the new JavaScript patterns. Most of today's browsers only understand the es6 version of JavaScript. we need to tell the Typescript compiler to transpile our Typescript code into es6 JavaScript.

- `"module": "commonjs"` - this is the JavaScript module formatting system for structuring and organizing JavaScript code. This let's the compiler use module functions such as `require()` and objects such as `module.exports`.

- `"rootDir": "./src"` - a directory where the input Typescript files are stored. I named the folder are `src`.

- `"outDir": "./build"` - this an output directory where the output structure of the compiled JavaScript will be saved. In this case, JavaScript code will be saved in a folder called to `build` in the root directory of the main project.

- `"moduleResolution": "node"` - a module import resolution algorithm that mimics the way the Node.js searches for modules in real-time.

- `"strict": true` - enable all JavaScript strict type-checking options.

- `"esModuleInterop": true` - esModuleInterop allows us to compile ES6 modules to commonjs modules.

- `"exclude":[]` - tells Typescript not to compile specified files or folders. In this case, you can tell the Typescript not to compile the `node_modules` folder since it already installed the JavaScript versions of Node.js library dependencies. I.e.;

```json
"exclude":[
    "./node_modules"
]
```

Check this [tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) to learn more options that you can include in your tsconfig.json file.

Here is an example of a `tsconfig.json` file option.

```JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {                        
    "target": "es6",                               
    "module": "commonjs",                           
    "outDir": "./dist",                             
    "rootDir": "./src",                             
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,                       
  },
  "exclude":[
    "./node_modules"
]
}
```

Feel free to add or change this file as needed to configure the Typescript compiler to your application and environment needs.

### Using Typescript with Node.js

Go ahead and create the folder `src` in your project directory. `src` host `.ts` files as explained earlier. Inside `src`, create an `index.ts` file and start writing some Typescript code. While writing down Typescript, it is advisable to have a Typescript compiler installed in your project's local dependencies. Run `npm install -D typescript` to do so.

```ts
function sum (num1:number, num2:number){
    return num1 + num2;
}
console.log(sum(8,4))
```

Let's see how we can execute the above Typescript using Node.js. Run `tsc` to build Typescript into JavaScript. This will build, compile and output JavaScript code into the path you specified in `"outDir": "./dist"` of the `config.json` file.

![Compiled JavaScript](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/compiled-javascript.png)

Now you should run `node dist/index.js` to print the results.

![Results](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/sum-results.png)

Running the above every single time in a development environment can be annoying. To make this process easier, you need to install a package called `ts-node`.

```bash
npm install -D ts-node
```

[Ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) allows us to point to a Typescript file. It will run `.ts`, compile it and run it with Node.js for us.

Go ahead and configure your `package.json` script tag and start the build command as shown below.

```json
"scripts": {
   "start": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
}
```

You can now run `npm start` to execute the `index.ts`. And when you delete the dist folder with the compiled `index.js` then still run `npm start`, you will get the same results.

### Using Typescript with packages
The climax of using Typescript and Node.js is the ability to utilize the open-source NPM packages and frameworks. Let me demonstrate how we can use Typescript to start interacting with NPM packages.

This example will set up Typescript With Express.js. You should install [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) from the NPM registry. So run `npm install express`.

**Note:** Always make sure you have [Node.js types checking package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node) installed whenever writing Typescript using Node.js.

```bash
npm install -D @types/node
```

Node.js packages are written in JavaScript and not Typescript. To get the type definitions for its packages, you need to install third-party packages called `@types`. For example, to use [Express type definations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/express), install `@types/express` by running `npm install -D @types/express`. This will give you access to type definitions for Express.

Not all packages have `@types`. Package with types has the following NPM `@types` tag.

![Npm types declarations](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/npm-types-declarations.png)

Let's set a simple Express server using Typescript.

- Import the package. When using Node.js, you would typically import a package using the `require()` function. With Typescript, this is a little different. Use the keyword `import` to access a package module, as shown below.

```ts
import express, {Request,Response,Application} from 'express';
```

- Initialize Express inside Typescript.

```ts
const app:Application = express();
```

- Set the server port.

```ts
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
```

- Set an end point/route.

```ts
app.get("/", (req:Request, res:Response):void => {
  res.send("Hello Typescript with Node.js!")
});
```

- Listen to the server port.

```ts
app.listen(PORT, ():void => {
  console.log(`Server Running here ðŸ‘‰ https://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

- Run `npm start` to set the server up and running. And when you open `https://localhost:8000/` in your browser, a response will be sent back to you as defined in the `res.send()`.

When developing an extensive application, it's advisable to hook your project with watch parameters that will help you restart your server whenever you make and saves changes to your code structure. There are two main options:

1. Ts-node-dev - [Ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev) basically watches `.ts` files, and whenever you make a change, it will restart the server for you. Run `npm install -D ts-node-dev` to install it. To use it, modify the `package.json` script tag as shown below.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn ./src/index.ts"
}
```

Then run `npm run dev`, and your server will be watched every time you make changes in your code.

![Ts-node-dev](/engineering-education/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-typescript-with-nodejs/ts-node-dev.png)

2. Nodemon - [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) works the same as Ts-node-dev. Run `npm install -D nodemon` to install it. To use it in your project, edit the `package.json` script tag as follows.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon ./src/index.ts"
}
```

Then run `npm run dev`.

### Conclusion

Typescript will help you in the development process so that you don't struggle with bugs and minor errors. It catches errors during compilation and before code runtime. This gives you an eye ahead to figure out and fix runtime errors. This will improve your development speed, especially when building an extensive application.

Typescript has become a [popular language](/engineering-education/typescript-static-typing/) among JavaScript developers. Check this [tutorial](/engineering-education/a-friendly-beginner-guide-to-typescript/) and learn how to get started with Typescript.
