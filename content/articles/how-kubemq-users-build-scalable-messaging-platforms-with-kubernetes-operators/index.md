### Introduction
The adoption of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) has grown rapidly over the past few years. According to surveys, it clearly shows that most organizations are adopting Kubernetes in production.

Adopting Kubernetes allows the organization to create the management layer that commodifies cloud and build cross/hybrid-cross deployments that abstract the provider-specific implementations from the rest of the team.

The most crucial feature of Kubernetes is the [operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator). Operators deploy and manage the state of applications using [Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/). Therefore, they are critical when deploying applications in cross or hybrid environments. They also help to manage and maintain states over multiple [Kubernetes clusters](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/kubernetes-cluster) running together or [across clusters](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/heterogeneous-deployment-patterns-with-kubernetes).

This article sheds light on the use of operators and their functions in Kubernetes. Also, it will expound on how the [KubeMQ](https://kubemq.io/) as a messaging platform utilizes features of operators to build complex and scalable messaging solutions with less code and overhead.

### What are Operators?
In short, operators automate tasks over what native Kubernetes offers. Operators are application extensions that connect into Kubernetes APIs and the control plane to build and manage a [Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CR). The Custom Resource defines the preferred state of the application. The control plane component checks the Custom Resource to establish whether the application is running according to expectations.

For instance, an operator can be used in deploying and scaling a [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), taking and restoring the database, managing the network services and ingresses, or managing a persistent data store.

In consideration that operators can connect with native Kubernetes tools such as [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), they are usually used to manage complex deployments where the state is involved.

Users can utilize [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) to deploy and manage stateless applications; an example is a web server. It is also possible to deploy stateful systems such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/), and KubeMQ. Operators can be attributed to the success of the above tasks.

### Benefits and core components of KubeMQ
KubeMQ is a message broker or queue and a messaging platform that can develop a message-based architecture that functions across [multi/hybrid](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/multicloud-vs-hybrid-cloud/) clouds and [edge computing](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3224893/what-is-edge-computing-and-how-it-s-changing-the-network.html).

With KubeMQ services in the above environments can communicate with each other using any messaging pattern such as [pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview), [streams](https://docs.cloudera.com/csp/2.0.1/howto-smm.html), and [queues](https://aws.amazon.com/message-queue/). KubeMQ is Kubernetes native and can be implemented in the shortest time possible.

### KubeMQ core components
The KubeMQ consists of the following components. These are server, [bridges](https://docs.kubemq.io/learn/kubemq-connectors/kubemq-bridges), [sources](https://docs.kubemq.io/learn/kubemq-connectors/kubemq-sources), and [targets](https://docs.kubemq.io/learn/kubemq-connectors/kubemq-targets).

- **Server** – It is deployed to every Kubernetes cluster, which manages the messaging processing.
- **Bridges** – assists in developing the preferred messaging topology across Kubernetes clusters, transmitting messages between KubeMQ servers.
- **Sources**- receive messages from existing systems such as [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) directs them to the KubeMQ platform.
- **Targets** – transmit messages to third-party systems such as PostgreSQL, [Redis](https://redis.io/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), or other messaging systems like [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/).

The above components allow the user to create a no-code-message-based microservices and [cross-cluster](https://www.improbable.io/blog/introducing-kedge-a-fresh-approach-to-cross-cluster-communication) messaging architecture on Kubernetes.

### KubeMQ and operators
For KubeMQ to operate at a native Kubernetes level, it is first deployed as an operator. One advantage of using KubeMQ is that it works well when small clusters are bundled together rather than having one massive cluster.

This translates to improved performance, better scalability, and resilience. The approach has had its success in utilizing operators as the management and deployment tool for KubeMQ. The operators deploy clusters and verify if the KubeMQ bridges, sources, and targets are set appropriately for each cluster. It also extends to how KubeMQ was created to utilize [Go](https://github.com/kubemq-io/kubemq-go/blob/master/README.md). It improves KubeMQ performance and connects KubeMQ into native Kubernetes data models, events, and APIs; hence it is easy to manage the clusters' state. It also makes validation of the configuration easier.

Deploying KubeMQ as an operator also keeps overhead to a minimum. For instance, we can look at a big financial institution with many real-time messages enquiring for price quotes, a huge number of transactions, and client funding. An institution can opt for KubeMQ to reduce the high number of servers required to meet their vast needs. It will also allow the institution to reassign its operational overhead to other tasks instead of monitoring and maintaining the messaging infrastructure. At the same time, the institution can utilize the KubeMQ operator to scale its infrastructure based on the load. This can happen in the scenarios like when the market closes, or demand decreases, meaning that the clusters can also be scaled down.

### Cross/Hybrid cloud and operators
The KubeMQ operator assists in tracking the state, the main reason why KubeMQ is preferred for reliable cross/hybrid cloud deployments.

First, the state can verify that the required capacity and configurations are in place for each cluster. Comparing the required state in the Custom Resource against the existing state in Kubernetes enables the operator to ensure that errors are detected and addressed on time, capacity is added as per requirements, the various bridges, sources, and targets are also configured as preferred.

For instance, a business can leverage the above KubeMQ feature to run its messaging platform over edge computing systems alongside cloud deployments. It will ensure that better performance and reliability are guaranteed and allows the client to grow the business with new services without interruptions or downtime. The business will need to set up new clusters and configure them as per its needs. The fact that the KubeMQ operator verifies the Custom Resource definition avoids deploying clusters with faulty configurations.

### Conclusion
It is clear that operators are essential when a client wants to manage and deploy complex Kubernetes systems in the following ways:

- They utilize Kubernetes-native systems and APIs.
- An operator’s Custom Resource definition allows configuration management and validation during the deployment time.
- They assist in tracking the required state against the existing state and addresses any issues found between them.
- Operators are well understood; hence organizations need no additional training for operational success.

KubeMQ uses the Operator model to ensure users can build complex yet scalable messaging platforms with less coding and overhead. It also assists the users in getting great business value. It allows them to address any business problems quickly and effectively within the shortest time possible and with little resources while managing and maintaining their messaging infrastructure.
