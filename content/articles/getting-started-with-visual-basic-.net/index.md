Visual Basic.net is a multi-paradigm , object-oriented programming language .We implement it in the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45) developed by Microsoft .Visual Basic was invented in 2001 to replace Visual Basic 6 .

Visual Basic.Net is pronounced as "Visual basic dot net " . We commonly abbreviate it as VB.NET .

Although VB.NET is an evolved version of Visual Basic 6 ,it is not compatible with it , i.e. code written in Visual Basic 6 cannot be compiled under VB.NET

### Why VB.NET?
- VB.NET is a simple languge that is easy to understand for both novice and advanced programmers.
- With VB.NET you can create web applications with mordern features like performance counters ,file system and event logs.
- Since we implement VB.NET using the .NET framework , we can connect our applications to others created in languages that run on the same framework .
- You will enjoy drag and drop capabilities to replace any elements that you may need.
- The language is not case sensitive .

Although VB.NET may have a couple of advantages , it also has some drawbacks associated with it .They include :
- VB.NET is not able to handle pointers directly.
- Since VB.NET is an intermediate language , there is a large number of libraries required for the Just In Time compiler to interpret the application.


To get started, you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and compile code. We will be using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) as our text editor.

### Installing Visual Basic.Net 

After you have selected Visual Studio , choose .NET desktop develop and click *Modify*.

![vscode](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/visualstuio1.jpg)

After the installation, click *Launch* to get started.  

On the new window, choose *Create a new project*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/visualtudio2.png)

Once you have selected *Create a new project*, choose *"Install more tools and features"* then click *Next*.

![createproject](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/newproject1.png)

From the drop down menu , pick  *Visual basic* then  select *Console Application* from the list and click *Next*.

![picktemplate](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/newproject.png)

Enter your preferred project name and click *Next*. In this case, I will name my file *helloworld*.

![pickname](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/newproject2.png)

After selecting the target framework you desire , click *Create*.

Visual Code will automatically generate some VB.NET  code for you.

![project](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-.net/newproject3.png)

Let's look at the code.

We have the code that will be generated below. It's a *Hello World* program.
```vb  
Imports System

Module Program
    Sub Main(args As String())
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
    End Sub
End Module 

```
Press the *F5* key on your keyboard,to run your program, .
This will compile and run your code. 

A console window will open with the following output:
```bash
Hello World!

C:\Users\sa\source\repos\helloworld\helloworld\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\helloworld.exe (process 6544) exited with code 0.
To automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.
Press any key to close this window . . .

```
### The Syntax 
We will look at each line of code from our program generated by Visual Studio. 

**Line 1:** 

```vb
Imports System
```
This line is used to include a *namespace* ,System, in our program . With that namespace , we will be able to access all the methods defined in it without getting an error.
A Namespace can be defined as a group of code that is related to each other , it majorly consists of pieces of code such as classes, procedures and functions .

**Line 2:** 

```vb
Module Program
   'code declaration
End Module 
```
A module defines a refrence type available through out its namespace .We can also define it as a part of a program  that contains one or more routines . For our *helloworld* program we have declared our module and named it `Program`.Inside this module we will be able to define methods to be used by our program .To close our module we use the `End` keyword.

**Line 3:** 

```vb
Sub Main(args As String())
     'code declaration 
End Sub
```

Our module has one procedure, `Sub` .A procedure is a block of statements enclosed by a declaration statement and a matching end declaration.Its From this line where execution of our program will begin.Each program in VB.NET should have a `main` method .

**Line 4:**

```vb
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
```

`Console.WriteLine()` prints out text on the console. After printing a string it adds a new line character to the end of the string .In our program it will output  *"Hello World!"*.
Alternatively we can use `Console.Write()` instead of `Console.WriteLine()` .The main diffrence between these two is that `Console.Write()` *does not* add a new line character to the end of the string. More about the two commands can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/basic-input-output).

### Getting user input 
To read the next **characters** from a standard input stream we use `Console.ReadLine()`.

`Console.Read()` is used when we want to read the next **Character** from the standard input stream.

`Console.ReadKey()` obtains the next character pressed by the user.The pressed key is displayed in the console window.

### Comments in Visual Basic .NET
Comments help a programmer understand what the code does a certain stage.They are mainly used to make code readable and easy to understand.
Comments are ussually ignored by the complier when compiling the code.
In VB.NET comments start with a single apostophe `'` .
**Example**
```vb
    'This is a comment in VB.NET
```

Unfortunately for Visual Basic , we do not have block comments .All comments are single line comments.

**Tips on writing good comments**
- Ensure that your comments are not a duplicate of the code you have written. Some programmers tend to write comments that are very obvious and unnecessary.
- Comments should not act as an excuse of unclear code. e.g When a programmer writes a comment to explain a single character variable declared.
- When you find it hard to write a clear comment, your code might be where the problem is .
- Your comments should clear any confussion , not create it.
- Include links to additional refrences where you feel they will be most helpful.
- Write comments when fixing bugs too .

**Important points to note:**
- VB.NET is case-insesitive but the CLR (common language runtime)is case sensitive .
- VB.NET follows top to bottom order when executing a program

**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first VB.NET program.  

To learn a few more terms , we will write a simple program to add two numbers entered by the user.

```vb
Imports System

Module Program
    Sub Main(args As String())
        Dim firstNum, seconNum, sum As Integer
        Console.WriteLine("enter first number:")
        firstNum = Console.ReadLine()
        Console.WriteLine(" enter second number:")
        seconNum = Console.ReadLine()
        sum = firstNum + seconNum
        Console.WriteLine("the sum is:" & sum)
        Console.ReadLine()

    End Sub
End Module
```
Here's how the output will look like when we input our first number as 2 and the second as 6 :

```bash
enter first number:
2
 enter second number:
6
the sum is:8
```

Let's take a look at the new lines in this program.

```vb
Dim firstNum, seconNum, sum As Integer
```
This line declares variables that will store the user input and also the result of the addition done by the system .
`As Integer` means that the declared variables will be of the data type Integer `Int`. Apart from integers , we have other data types such as : 
   - String - stores any number of numerical ,alphabetic and special characters
    - Double - stores fractional numbers
    - Boolean - stores data as either True or False
    - Date - stores  the date value and has a range of January 1, 0001 - December 31, 9999. 
    - Byte - this is a one byte integer. it holds an unsigned value from 0 to 255

```vb
firstNum = Console.ReadLine()
```

This line assigns the user input to our declared variable for storage.We can see that this step is repeated for the second input under a diffrent variable, this is because a variable can only hold value for one input ,incase we assign a second it will replace the original one.
