### Introduction
Cloud computing refers to utilizing a network of remote servers residing on the internet for storage, managing, and processing data instead of a local server or physical computer. No organization should rush into cloud computing without understanding the specifics of their industry since most cloud vendors may not necessarily understand their clients’ industry.

This article will equip the readers with knowledge that can be utilized by experts who develop technology solutions for healthcare. It will enable them to gather more information on the clients’ preferred deployment model and is crucial in migration and custom software development.

### Concept of cloud computing in relation to healthcare
Cloud computing is not a new term in the IT world, and most organizations have been adapting it to ease their operations and significantly cut costs. To better understand the concept of the cloud, we can compare it with the traditional on-premises model.

The main difference between cloud and on-prem is about where the hardware, software, and applications reside. For an on-premises deployment, any infrastructure in the company is managed and maintained by the user company.

With the cloud solutions, the infrastructure is offsite, and it is maintained by a third-party cloud vendor, which also handles the security.

The concept of cloud computing in healthcare is not new in the field. Most industry leaders are adopting it and enjoying the benefits cloud computing is offering to the healthcare industry.

According to the recent surveys done, with the high spread of the [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) pandemic, the adoption of cloud computing by the healthcare sector has increased.

In addition, according to surveys, healthcare industries have made cloud migration among their top priorities, which have also enabled them to cut costs, as explained later in this article.

### Cloud computing deployment models in healthcare
Cloud migration in healthcare industries can be implemented by use of the below service models:
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** – means that medical data is stored in the cloud and accessed over the internet. Third-party cloud vendors have control over the environment and the users' data.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** – implies that the cloud vendors provide the platform where the organization's users can host and run their applications.
- **Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS)** – cloud providers give needed computing resources while company users have complete control over the entire infrastructure.

### Cloud computing applications in healthcare
Many applications utilize cloud computing in healthcare organizations. The most commonly used applications are:

#### Email
It is the most popular cloud computing application used in the healthcare industry.  Before medical facilities migrate to the cloud, email is the most common factor they consider.

Medical facilities should observe compliance and security policies of emails since it can lead to hefty penalties for [email-related violations](https://www.hipaajournal.com/is-it-a-hipaa-violation-to-email-patient-names/).

Most cloud vendors offer encryption services depending on the level of security needed by the organization.

In addition, some cloud solutions offer options for email filtering, which assists in blocking malicious inbound messages. It also checks if outbound messages adhere to policies to avoid confidential files from exiting the hospital's network.

#### Cloud faxing
Most healthcare organizations still use faxes as means of transmitting data. It was designed to allow medical facilities to send or receive digital data instead of paper.

Some cloud faxing vendors integrate their systems with hospital’s email accounts. These solutions greatly help to curb compliance violations as the content is encrypted and protected with a password.

In addition, cloud faxing keeps the updated logs of any activities, thus saving the users’ time that would have been spent sending the content manually, thereby minimizing human errors. It is also unlawful and can ruin the organization's reputation to send medical information to the wrong recipient.

#### Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMRs)
Cloud computing-based medical records are being utilized in healthcare organizations. Building an in-house EHR capacity, medical facilities incur huge costs since they need to purchase the hardware and software, set up infrastructure, acquire the licenses, update new modules and pay maintenance costs.

These costs are hugely cut using cloud computing, and the cloud offers higher security since it protects patients' records. This is done through access control, encryption, and logging.

Finally, cloud solution helps to improve on interoperability and enhances data sharing, which are equally important for future expansion plans.

### Cloud computing benefits in healthcare
#### Reduced costs and resource consumption
The main reason for migrating to a cloud solution in healthcare facilities is to gain access to computing power and storage without investing in infrastructure and hiring dedicated support staff.

Cloud computing operates on a pay-as-you-use basis, meaning hospitals pay for the services they are using and need. In addition, there is no need for updating and patching the system since cloud vendors take care of that. It also relieves the healthcare facilities from long-term contracts and licensing agreements.

In addition to saving the costs, hospitals can cut down on internal IT and human resource personnel since many applications can be consolidated into one, hence no need for massive applications and therefore cutting down on the number of servers needed.

#### Enhanced security
Right from the design, the cloud is made to be secure by default. It ranges from denying access to unauthorized users and services. The model is the opposite of what on-premises solutions offer since they are inherently open.

Moreover, cloud vendors work with highly qualified technical experts that most healthcare industries cannot recruit. The professionals conduct penetration testing and utilize other preventive measures to ensure that the system is always secure. They also use various security tools such as encryption, proactively monitoring, and addressing the security threats on time.

To improve on cloud security even more in healthcare, cloud vendors ensure they allocate more time and budget to monitor vulnerabilities all the time. They also assist in automatic backups and offers disaster recovery plans.

#### Offers scalability and flexibility
As healthcare organizations grow, they need more computing power and storage capacity. Cloud solutions can scale based on requirements with less disruption as the infrastructure is already available.

During a pandemic like COVID-19, medical facilities had increased patient volumes, meaning hospitals needed to purchase the latest hardware and updated software to handle the increased numbers. The hospitals that had adopted cloud computing earlier were less of a hassle since they only needed to scale up and afterward scale down after the pandemic.

#### Provides analytical capabilities
Most medical facilities produce a massive amount of structured and unstructured data each year. Most of that data is not used. Such data is essential, and if utilized well, can assist in decision making.

With cloud computing for healthcare, artificial intelligence subsets and big data analytics can be used to offer advanced computational capabilities. The system can aggregate and analyze vast amounts of relevant patients' data. Doctors, in turn, can utilize this information to improve on diagnosis process, craft customized treatment plans. They can also facilitate patient engagement and capture any missing information from patient's EHRs.

In addition, analytics are essential as they assist in spotting any malfunctioning in the hospitals' system. For instance, AI models are used to predict COVID-19 outbreaks. It would be impossible if the cloud never existed.

#### Ensures data interoperability
The main aim of interoperability is to ensure that data is integrated throughout the healthcare system regardless of its origins. It also ensures that data obtained from different sources can be shared and accessed more easily by different stakeholders.

Cloud computing in medicine facilitates interoperability among healthcare segments, such as insurance and pharmaceuticals.

### Cloud computing risks and possible solutions in healthcare
#### Loss of control and cloud outage
After migrating data to the cloud, health facilities control their assets to the cloud vendor. It is common, mainly when the SaaS model is used. This raises concerns with medical facilities as they have to protect the data, yet they do not control it, relying on what cloud vendors implement to keep their data and assets safe.

Moreover, cloud services can experience downtimes, forcing the hospitals to look for a way to operate while waiting for cloud providers to bring the services up. Downtimes are destructive in terms of productivity loss and can be life-threatening to patients in extreme conditions. This elicits some degree of unpredictability from both patients and providers.

##### Possible solution
If a healthcare facility needs to adopt a cloud solution, it can take several steps to minimize the negative impacts experienced during downtime. First, the medical facility has to come up with a disaster recovery plan. It is done by having a backup infrastructure installed elsewhere rather than on-premises.

Alternatively, a medical facility can go for a multi-cloud approach, where it can rely on several vendors to provide an alternative in case one system goes down.

#### Legacy system vulnerabilities
Most medical devices operate on legacy platforms, making it difficult for the medical facility to replace them before migrating to cloud computing. Integrating such systems into the cloud comes with a new set of risks. For instance, some legacy systems run on obsolete machine code and may contain serious security loopholes.

##### Possible solution
Before even migrating to cloud solutions, medical facilities should first identify and address any vulnerability that may come with legacy equipment. The facility may also consider using network segmentation to isolate high-risk devices that may cause potential breaches. This will limit the negative impact on the network caused by such devices.

#### Compliance issues
Patients’ data is protected under [strict regulations](https://datica.com/blog/what-are-the-hipaa-cloud-compliance-options-for-healthcare) offered by different authorities worldwide. The violation of these regulations destroys the hospital’s reputation and comes with adverse financial consequences.

The violating healthcare organizations are forced to pay restitution fees to the victim and, if deemed appropriate, a risk to serve a jail term. Healthcare organizations should ensure that they are compliant with regulations set during and even after cloud migration. It means they have to observe data storage security, access, patient privacy, and breach notifications.

##### Possible solution
The healthcare facility should be aware that some cloud providers do not adhere to a high degree of compliance. Additionally, a cloud vendor can be compliant but rely on tools from external/secondary vendors to secure the system. However, the secondary vendor may not be compliant, thereby compromising the overall compliance of the cloud solution.

It means that healthcare organizations should carefully evaluate their cloud vendors to ensure that the solutions they are offering meet mandatory regulations and that all documents needed are signed.

#### Poor organizational preparation
Before healthcare organizations migrate to the cloud solution, they should adequately prepare. They need to check if their existing systems and processes are well documented and possess enough knowledge on how their systems work. This reduces the chances of errors been transferred to the cloud and gives the organization a chance to fix its current system.

In addition, some clients never trust their cloud solution providers, hence misusing time and resources maintaining their private environment to protect the data in the cloud.

##### Possible solution
Healthcare organizations are required to prepare adequately for a cloud solution and adopt it. They need to do technological assessments, analyze their existing platforms, prioritize what to move, and finally get the data ready to be migrated.

In addition, healthcare organizations need to familiarize themselves with their selected cloud platform in advance and involve all the users to make them ready for change and accept new ways after migration.

#### Security
It is possible to argue that the cloud is more secure compared to on-premises storage. However, the cloud still faces risks of data breaches and malware attacks. In most cases, it might be the problem with cloud vendors, but employee errors and internal intentional attacks cause some issues.

##### Possible solution
The healthcare organization must be ready to choose cloud vendors that offer a consistent offline backup solution to fight cloud computing security risks. The organization can recover its data from offline backup rather than paying ransom to the attacker.

Robust encryptions methods also need to be implemented so that information will still be unreadable whenever data breaches.

Healthcare organization needs to offer cybersecurity courses to their staffs. Also, a cyber-security-based assessment should be performed before choosing the cloud vendor, contractor, or any other external collaborators.

### Conclusion
Migrating to the cloud is a challenging process, and healthcare organizations should define their goals, cloud options, among others. This would enable them to set their goals and determine which system and data components they want to migrate.

Good research on different cloud vendors should be performed to understand their offerings better. They should also have compliance in mind as not all cloud providers are compliant to avoid any regulations violations.

Moreover, if the healthcare application uses the [public cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/public-cloud), the security of those applications purely lies on the organization and not the cloud vendor.

Finally, suppose the healthcare organization is not sure on which cloud deployment models suit its needs. In that case, the organization should consult with the different cloud vendors for their offers and advice.
