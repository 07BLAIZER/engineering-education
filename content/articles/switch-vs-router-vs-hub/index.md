In networking the terms "Switches", "Hubs", and "Routers" are sometimes used interchangeably and this is wrong. Despite them being similar, there are differences in how they handle data. These three components may be integrated into a single device making it hard for a student to distinguish between them.

In this article, we are going to discuss each device and their functionalities in a network. i.e
- [What is a Switch](#switch)
- [What is a Hub](#hub)
- [What ia a Router](#router)

- [Function of each Device](#function)
- [Application of each Device](#application)

### What is a Switch?
A switch is a multicast networking device that works under the Datalink layer of the OSI model and connects a bunch of computers or devices in a network. It is mainly used to send a private message and it does not waste data. 

A switch can easily identify which device is connected to which port by using a MAC address giving it the ability to deliver the message to a particular machine. 

### Advantages of using a Switch
- It is secure since it delivers data to the specified node.
- Lowers the chances of frame collisions domains.
- It increases the bandwidth in a network.
- It increases the number of ports needed to connect the nodes available in a network.
- It operates under full-duplex.

### Disadvantages of using Switches
- They are more expensive compared to hubs and other devices used in a network.
-  To deal with multicast parcels, proper planning is required.
- It can raise problems in broadcast traffic.

<a name="hub"></a>
### What is a Hub?
Hub is a simple and cheap networking device that works under the physical layer of the OSI model and connects a bunch of computers in a Local Area Network(LAN). (It does lots of wastage of bandwidth). A hub is considered less intelligent because it does not filter data and does not know where the data is to be sent.

All information sent to a hub is automatically sent to all ports of the devices connected to it.
 
### Advantages of using hubs
 - Ability to connect to the network using different physical media.
 - They can be used to increase the network distance.
 - Hubs are relatively cheap compared to switches and other devices in the network.

### Disadvantages of using hubs
- It increases the chances of collision domains between packets when being transferred from one device to another.
- Hubs operate under half-duplex that's only one occasion of data transmission at a time.
- Hubs share data to all the devices in a network thus insecure.
- Hubs does lots of wastage of bandwidth when transmitting data.

### Switch Vs Hub
- Hub is a broadcast device that sends data from one node to all but Switch is a multicast device that can send data to a particular node you want.
- A Hub supports half-duplex i.e only one device can send or receive data at a time while a switch supports full-duplex i.e both devices can send and receive data at the same time.
- A switch is located on the second layer of the OSI model while a Hub is located on the first layer.
- We shall look at more differeces in this article.


<a name="router"></a>
### What is a Router?
A router is a networking device that operates under the network layer of the OSI model and is used to connect two or more different networks. It is a device that establishes a common link between networks to set up data flow between them. 

### Advantages of Routers
- With the aid of dynamic routing algorithms, it has the ability to choose the best path in the internetwork.
- It creates collision domains to reduce network traffic.
- It provides connections between network architectures.

### Disadvantages of Routers 
- They are expensive compared to other devices in a network.
- They need to analyze data making them slower.
- Low bandwidth because of dynamic router communication.

Let's look at the differences of each of them:

<a name="layer"></a>
### Layer of each component in the OSI model
The [OSI Model](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/) (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a 7 layer model that is used to describe in a pictorial way how computer systems communicate. Switch, Router, and Hub each operate on a different layer.

#### Switch
A switch is located on the OSI model's Data Link layer i.e the second layer. The link layer is specific to the medium over which the packet is traveling such as Ethernet and the Mac Address are part of this layer.

#### Router
A router works in the Network Layer of the OSI model and it is the third layer.

#### Hub
Hub works in the Physical Layer of the OSI model and it is the first layer.

<a name="function"></a>
### Function of each Device
#### Switch
- It allows various connections of many devices in the same network and the management of port and VLAN security settings.
- Learning - This is the process of collecting the MAC address of linked devices.
- Forwarding - This is the process of transferring network traffic from one device connected to one port of a Network Switch to another device connected to another port.
- Preventing Layer 2 Switching Loops - In a Local Area Network, redundant connections are built to prevent the entire network from failing if one link fails. Layer 2 switching loops and broadcast storms can be caused by redundant connections. A network switch's job is to prevent layer 2 switching loops and broadcast storms.

#### Router
- Its major purpose is to connect many types of networks at the same time using adaptive and non-adaptive routing. 
- The router is connected to at least two networks and decides how to deliver each data packet depending on its current knowledge of the network status.
- If the packet is traveling to the LAN, the router bounces it back. The packet will be toured depending on the routing table if this is not the case.Â 

#### hub
- Hub is a simple and cheap networking device that allows a bunch of computers to be connected to a single network 
- When a hub receives a data packet (an Ethernet frame) from a network device at one of its ports, it broadcasts (repeats) the packet to all of its ports to all other network devices. A collision occurs when two network devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time.

<a name="application"></a>
### Application of each Device
#### Switch
- It is commonly used in local area networks for connecting many nodes.
- Forwards a message to a specific host - On each port, a switch, like a bridge, employs the same forwarding or filtering logic. When a host or switch on the network transmits a message to another host or switch on the same network, the switch receives the frames and decodes them to read the physical (MAC) address component of the message.
- Increase LAN bandwidth - A switch divides a LAN into many collision domains, each with its own broadband connection, considerably improving the LAN's bandwidth.

#### Router
- It is commonly used in Local Area Network and Metropolitan Area Network(MAN).
- Manage traffic - By forwarding data packets to their proper IP addresses, traffic between these networks may be managed.
- It determines the best path to send packets

#### hub
- It is similar to Switch because it is used in the local area network(LAN).
- It is used for network monitoring.
- They are also used in organizations to provide connectivity.
- It can be used to create a device that is available thought out of the network.

### Mode of data transmission
It defines the direction in which data flow between two communicating devices. There are three types of transmission modes:
1. Simplex - In this type of transmission, data can only move to one direction i.e a device can only send data but cannot receive and the receiver can only receive but cannot send the data.
2. Half-Duplex - only one device can send or receive data at a time but not both at the same time.
3. Full Duplex - A device can send and receive data at the same time.

Read this [documentation](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-data-transmission-modes-in-a-network) for more information on the Mode of data transmission

#### Switch
It supports full-duplex transmission thus a bunch of computers can send data at the same time.

#### Router
It supports full-duplex transmission thus a bunch of computers can send data at the same time.

#### Hub
It supports half duplex in transmission thus only one node can send data at a time.

<a name="address"></a>
### Addresses used in each devives
#### Switch
Switch stores and uses the MAC address of a device to transfer data.

#### Router
A router uses the IP address to transfer data between networks.

#### Hub
Hub does not store any MAC/IP address to transfer data.

<a name="transmission"></a>
### Transmission of Data
#### Switch
Switch transmit data from one device to another in form of [frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking)).

#### Router 
The router transmits data from one network to another in form of [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/).

#### Hub
Hub transmits data from one device to another in form of binary bits.
