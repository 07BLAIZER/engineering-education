### Introduction
Choosing the proper JavaScript framework for a project can be challenging and confusing, especially if many options that are resourceful and capable of facilitating project requirements are available. However, choosing the right one requires knowledge of several critical aspects.

For a developer choosing between different best frontend platforms like Angular and React for a project can be a struggle. At some point, developers get stuck even when making simple features work.

However, it is impossible to define the best, but we can analyze which one is better based on situations and the project one is developing. In this article, we will discuss between two most used platforms worldwide, [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) and [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### Comparison between Angular and React
Angular is a JavaScript fully-fledged framework, while React.js is a JavaScript library. So the two platforms are different. Thus there is a need for common ground for comparing the two.

Below is the table that will help us understand the technical specifications of the two platforms based on the factors listed.

Factor|Angular|React |
----------------|-------|----- |
Release Year| 2009 | 2013
Ideal For| Creating highly active and interactive web applications | Creating large web applications with frequently varying data
DOM | Real | Virtual
App Size | Relatively small | Relatively small
Performance | High | High
Dynamic UI Binding | UI binding at a plain object or property level | Direct linking of states to the UI
Data Binding | Two-way | One-way
Learning Curve | Steep | Moderate
UI Rendering | Client/Server side | Client/Server side
Price | Open-source | Open-source

Next will be to compare the factors in details as below:

#### Popularity Growth
Angular and React have gained popularity over time in the discussion forums and a number of the developersâ€™ community. However, React.js is a library compared to Angular, which is a fully-fledged framework.

On the contrary, React.js, a library with comparatively more stars than Angular, is a fully-fledged framework. The main reason why React.js has more number of stars and fewer issues is because of its early release.

#### Performance
React.js is known for having boosting performance, but also Angular is not lagging in the competition.

Angular has what it takes to optimal coding practices, leading to an established level of programming where performance is greatly enhanced. Therefore, the developers need to consider it while evaluating the Angular and React performance.

For instance, optimizing the [digest cycle](https://www.dotsquares.com/news_events/what-is-digest-cycle-in-angular-js-and-how-does-it-make-two-way-data-binding-possible/#:~:text=Digest%20cycle%20is%20what%20Angular,the%20code%20encounters%20a%20directive.) for the proposed code structure. One can develop a [codebase](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23962/codebase) for further modules, monitor and optimize the loop while verifying the changes that have been previously assessed.

Angular has the [cacheFactory](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$cacheFactory) that works for memorization, which can be used for recalculating the data later.

React.js introduces the component reusability. It is a common practice among designers as it doubles productivity and optimizes coding practices.

Practising such coding habits leads to app performance consistency. It also ensures code quality and maintenance even if the application is complex.

#### Testing
A dynamically typed language like JavaScript makes testing challenging to achieve fully. Therefore code written in JavaScript has to go through a robust set of tests.

Angular offers several features, including isolation of the unit code written with testability in mind.

For instance, Angular comes with a [dependency injection](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/) feature, which assists in the passing of dependencies of components. However, the feature can also mock the components.

When writing tests, mocking the parts that do not exist in the testing environments is preferable. The reason is that tests can read and interact with the other parts of the function and predict their actions. In addition, the mocking of function or data is useful because it minimizes the inconsistency in data fetching.

In React.js, tests are predictable due to the availability of the [mocking functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api). Moreover, it executes test suites continuously to test cases as part of the development process.

React.js also comes with test runners such as [Ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) that runs tests while already running the development process.

Jest is compatible with other features like [mocked modules](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks), [timers](https://jestjs.io/docs/timer-mocks), and [Jdsm](https://openbase.com/js/jest-date-mock) support. Also, libraries like Mocha are well-suited with requirements specific to the browser and support simulations such as a real browser.

#### Code Quality
Angular comes with a tool that improves code quality known as [AngularCLI](https://angular.io/cli). It supports integrations from [Angular Core](https://angular.io/api/core#:~:text=%40angular%2Fcorelink&text=Implements%20Angular's%20core%20functionality%2C%20low%2Dlevel%20services%2C%20and%20utilities.&text=Defines%20the%20decorators%20that%20supply,various%20testing%20and%20debugging%20facilities.), [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started), making project deliveries easy and maintaining code quality.

With AngularCLI, the learning curve of Angular has significantly been reduced. Developers can predict compilation behaviour. Due to this, the smooth build is generated, and iterating efforts by developers reduced, which may lead to bad code quality in the end.

React.js has many things that increase the code quality and give an identity different from other frameworks.

It is easy to maintain code quality because of the code review practices put by React.js through the use of [Linters](https://www.testim.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-heres-a-definition-and-quick-start-guide/). Moreover, it helps in generating consistent coding practices among the developers in a given organization. Linters follows a set of strict rules, and therefore, the codebase is kept consistent.

#### Code Maintainability
Angular is known for developing single-page applications. The single-page applications have complex structures with several programming modules. They tend to place program files in separate files.

To maintain such a complex structure and keeping an application rich leads to a framework that allows for complex maintainability and capability to manage complex naming conventions.

Often developers deal with the problem of code maintainability when building rich web clients. In addition, using both JavaScript and HTML is challenging due to minimal modularization.

Angular overcomes these challenges by the use of maintainable JavaScript. Furthermore, it provides an HTML extension to deal with such challenges, thereby relieving developers and saves time.

Developers always inquire about best practices on maintaining the code quality and making a habit of writing a clean code from scratch. However, it proves challenging to write a clean code without delaying
the production. React.js is better when writing a clean code with the same timeframe and quality production.

It shows the developers not rewrite the same code again and get confused between code review comments. React.js has made developers write code that works among small modules minimizing redundancy.

React.js does allow developers to write in splits and makes it usable by computer and more readable by the developers. In addition, it facilitates code reusability by the use of reusable UI components during development.

React.js allows developers to create customized components that can display the uncontrolled input fields. Moreover, components can be easily recognized with unique naming conventions.

#### Server Rendering
In Angular application is rendered first by creating a static view, then it gets interactive. It is entirely on developers to use both JSON and [client-side caching](https://medium.com/js-360/intro-to-client-side-caching-with-service-worker-354ce8ae831a) to boost the server's performance. Angular is the best when it comes to traffic reduction between client and server.

An angular test requirement can reduce the code by minimizing the need for recompiling. It also quickly reflects the changes made in the frontend.

For the application to be [SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) strong, the application is needed to be rendered to the server. React.js does it at best with the help of specific functions. For example, it can be done by calling the [RenderToString()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-render-to-string) instead of calling Render. However, React.js is not a rigid library that would restrict one from benefiting from other JavaScript frameworks.

Also, [renderToStaticMarkup()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) can be used to refrain from creating Document Object Model ([DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)) attributes such as data-react-id, responsible for creating a static page generator.

#### Optimizing the bundle size
Working with single-page applications is easy but tricky when it comes to managing the bundle file size. Most websites do not load at first click, and this is so because the file has to be downloaded at the initial page called a bundle file. Therefore the file has to be optimized as much as possible.

The bundle file size is essential to consider when developing an enterprise-grade application for it to run smoothly. In addition, analyzing the bundle file size is essential for optimizing the application's codebase.

It is crucial to monitor the bundle file size because new features constantly added, and dependencies occur over the new requirements.

#### Learning Curve
Angular is broad and flexible; for this reason, developers find it difficult to cover most topics in Angular at the initial stage. However, it is worth giving ample time at the first phase to enjoy better developing the applications. Angular has a higher learning curve compared to that of React.js at the initial stage.

One is advised to pick on one based on project requirements. For example, angular is best when it comes to solving the most challenging problems in large-scale projects.

In React, developers may find it absurd to write at the first stages since it does not require any complexity.

React.js will not request a developer first to learn and encounter the complexities of learning logical structures but learning basics along with state management and routing library.

### Reasons for using Angular
-   It has inbuilt features such as AngularCLI and [Rxjs](https://www.learnrxjs.io/), significant increating data exchange channels and independent handling of events. Also, creating applications, adding files, and code debugging is easy.
-   It overall optimizes the developer's efforts by having fewer lines of code and parallelly running components.
-   Increases the overall application performance
-   Enhances rapid server-side rendering, therefore supporting the views
 that may lack browser-side rendering

### Reasons for using React.js
-   Unlike in Angular, developers can integrate external entities to
 access specific functions of React.js and the fully
 interactive functionalities.
-   It has state containers such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started), which assists in faster development of scalable applications like dynamic elements and managing rendering.
-   It converts [JavaScript XML](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) into JavaScript for a browser to understand
-   Better when one wants to use code bundlers such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)
-   Ideal when one is using the URL router library such as [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

### Angular and React.js Use Cases
Angular and React.js have both made popular applications used worldwide. Below are two cases for using Angular and React.js:

#### Case 1:
For a complex UI project and starting off the project from scratch, React.js is simpler to use. On the other hand, if a developer has a longer learning curve, Angular and React.js will be best because of their short learning curve.

#### Case 2:
Angular can be regarded as a complete package since it facilitates important functionalities as a built-in part. 

One cannot compare Angular functionalities with a library like React.js. Nevertheless, typescript experts opt to use it as their framework of development.

### Conclusion
In the end, depending on the project requirements, one can choose between the two technologies. For example, a developer can use React.js if an application is not huge and requires a small learning curve.

On the other hand, developing a huge application with extensive features, the team can go for Angular since its bigger learning curve is not a problem compared with the benefits it offers.

React.js is easy to use since the developer does not have to organize HTML but can reuse the UI components. In addition, angular can handle multiple things independently without depending on any additional help, and it may seem technical at first. However, the benefit it offers foresee the extended concept and overlooks the time invested.
