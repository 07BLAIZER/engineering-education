### 10 of the most annoying UI/UX mistakes to avoid while crafting your products

UI/UX plays a major part in the success of your products. It is the first and the last thing that the customer sees, and interacts with.

User interface is a complex subject, and there are many different ways to build a good user experience. User experience is not only about the look and feel of the interface, but also about the way the user interacts with it. The effectiveness and ease of use is a big factor in the success of your product.

Here are a few UI/UX mistakes that really annoy us, the users.

### 1. Images
Graphics play a major in passing information. Too large image sizes will make your product take longer to load. The right size is a balance between the size of the image and the amount of detail you want to show.

For example, when listing users with their avatars side by side, the avatars should be small in size since loading large avatars will take a lot of time. Banner images on the other hand should be large in size, because they are not used in a lot of places and their detail is important.

Something else that you should avoid when using images, is low-quality images. Low-quality images lack the sense of detail.

To balance image quality and size, optimization comes in to play.

Image optimization reduces the size of an image to the minimum necessary to display it. This is done by compressing the image, reducing the number of colors, and removing unnecessary information.

When dealing with many images, you should consider using services like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to host, cache and optimize your images.

### 2. Placing all the validation warnings in the same place
Each form field should have its own validation warnings just below the input. This makes it easier to find which fields are throwing the errors.

### 3. Showing the validation errors before the user has finished typing in a field
Throwing the validation errors before the user has finished inputting that email or password is veeery annoying.

You should wait for the user to finish typing in a field before showing the validation errors. The errors should be shown only after the user has clicked outside the field, but not after every keystroke.

### 4. Design inconsistencies
You should use consistent styling to your components. If you decide to use a border-radius of 20, stick to that all through.

Using too much colors in your design is also a bad idea. It makes it hard to keep related components together.

You can get balanced color palletes from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co)

If you have a multi-platform app, the appearance of the app on all the platforms should be consistent.

### 5. Very wide paragraph
Having a very wide paragrah that spans to the full width of the screen makes it hard to read.

Large paragraphs make it hard to follow a sentence to the next line. Paragraphs should take a maximum of 50-75 characters per line. They should also be centered to help the users concentrate on what they are reading and to be able to follow the content line after line.

### 6. Small clickable areas
Small clickable areas such as handles and cancel buttons is an issue, especially to mobile users.

Small buttons such as cancel buttons ‚ùé should be large enough for ease of click. They should not be close to the edges. They should be clickable without triggering other events, such as scroll.

### 7. Clickable vs Unclickable elements
Clickable elements should look clickable.

One way of making a clickable element look clickable is by adding a hover state. When a pointer is hovering over the element, it should change its color or do something else to make it look clickable. You can add a border, some border radius and also change the pointer to a pointer cursor when the element is hovered.

Since there are no pointers in mobile devices, you can use a different styling approach to make the button look clickable.

### 8. Non-responsive components
All elements in your design should be responsive on small screens. 

Consider a page where a user must scroll horizontally to read half of the paragraph. The user will have to zoom out to read the full paragraph. This makes the font size very small harder to read. 

You should test your web app across a multiple devices or browsers to make sure that all the elements are responsive.

### 9. Video autoplay
So you open a website to read this article. Suddenly, some video starts playing at the bottom of the page.

What can be more annoying than that?

Autoplay is one of the most annoying features of the web. It is a major concern especially for mobile devices, where users are more likely to be on a mobile connection.

If you want to add a video to your page, unless it's less than a few seconds long, you should not autoplay it.

### 10. Poor search engines
Search engines are one way people find content on your site. Providing the most relevant results is very helpful to your users.

Returning relevant result might involve a lot of work, but it's beneficial. For example, you will have to manually identify all the keywords for each item, if you are working with static site generators. Precise keywords increase the accuracy of the search results.

The most relevant results should always be in the top rows of the search results.

### Final remarks
We have looked at a few mistakes that make the user experience of your products a mess. Some of them may not make a lot of sense to a developer, but they are an issue to the user.

To avoid UI/UX mistakes, it's very recommended that you have a team to test your product.

Now that you are aware of what your users don't want, why don't you give them what they want?

Happy coding!

See you in the next one.
