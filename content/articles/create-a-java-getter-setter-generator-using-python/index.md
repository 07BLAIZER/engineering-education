Python's getters and setters are unique. They allow data encapsulation while others have hidden fields for private variables. 
<!--more-->
Several OOPÂ languages use getters and setters to store data. We conceal an object class's attributes so other classes' methods do not alter data accidentally.

In object-oriented languages, these methods get and change data. Setting an object's attribute value is called `setting`. In this article, we will learn how to use Python's getter and setter methods.

### Understanding getters and setters
The value which a getter method returns is its argument. This is useful for OOP private property access. A setter modifies a property's value. 

This helps establish private class characteristics in object-oriented programming. Using getters and setters ensures there is data encapsulation.

Why do we use setters and getters:
- To promote encapsulation.
- To keep the interface even if the internals change.
- To add validation logic to value acquisition and setting.
- To externalize the property's internal representation.
- To ensure there is no direct access or change to a class field.
- Access levels are configured using getters and setters.

### Get getters and setters behavior using normal functions
If we use the standard `get()` and `set()` methods to get the getters and setters property, there will be no need for any extra specific implementation code.

```python 
class section:
    def __init__(ascetic, span = 0):   
         ascetic._span = span     
    def get_span(ascetic):   
        return ascetic._span    
    def set_span(ascetic, k):   
        ascetic._span = k  
    
kelvin = section()   
kelvin.set_span(34)   
print(kelvin.get_span())   
print(kelvin._span)
```

Output:

```bash 
34
34
```

Because the methods `get age()` and `set age()` are regular functions, they may provide the needed functionality. Python has a distinguishing function ().

### Get getters and setters behavior using @Property decorators
This method returns a property object in Python. Methods for getting, setting, and deleting properties (). It takes four parameters in Python. This method gets an attribute's value from the file. fset sets an attribute's value. fdel deletes an attribute value. No documentation is created by default. Getter(), setter(), and deleter() (). Get, set, and delete (). Consider the following example:

```python
class Section:   
     def __init__(ascetic):   
          ascetic._span = 0  
     def get_span(ascetic):   
         print("The getters method")   
         return ascetic._span  
     def set_span(ascetic, k):   
         print("The setters method")   
         ascetic._span = k   
     def del_span(ascetic):   
         del ascetic._span   
     span = property(get_span, set_span, del_span)    
    
kelvin = Section()   
    
kelvin.span = 23  
    
print(kelvin.span)  
```

The output of the code

```bash
The setters method
The getters method
23
```

The above program has one print statement. The output has three lines since the setter method set `span()` and the getter function get `span()` were both invoked. So span is a property object that helps secure private variable access.

### Get getters and setters behavior using the property() function
The prior technique used the `property()` method to achieve getters and setters. Getters and setters are used to check attribute values. A decorator may impose property function, `@property` decorates Python. The main goal of a decorator is to change class methods or attributes without modifying user code.

```python
class Section:   
     def __init__(ascetic):   
          ascetic._span = 0  
        
     @property  
     def span(ascetic):   
         print("The getters method")   
         return ascetic._span   
         
       
     @span.setter   
     def span(ascetic, k):   
         if(k < 20):   
            raise ValueError("the span is ineligible")   
         print("The setters method")   
         ascetic._span = k   
    
kelvin = Section()   
    
kelvin.span = 32 
    
print(kelvin.span)
```

Output:

```bash
The setters method
The getters method
32
```

The `@property` decorator is used to construct Python getters and setters as shown in the code above. A `ValueError` is raised if the span is set to less than 32 in the previous example, which acts as validation code.

### Project algorithm
In this project, we have a list of variable names and data types and must display all their getter-setter functions while adhering to fundamental Java programming rules.

To be able to do this we follow the algorithm below:
- Transform the first character of each variable into an uppercase letter.
- Add the word "get" to the beginning of each variable that has been updated and put them in a list.
- Add the word "set" at the beginning of each variable that has been updated and save them in a list.
- Print the getter and setter methods for each variable and its corresponding datatype via string concatenation for each variable and its corresponding datatype.

### Implementation of the algorithms

```python
def print_getter_setter(variables, datatypes):

    getters = []
    setters = []
    for var in variables:
        getter = "get" + var[0].capitalize() + var[1:]
        getters.append(getter)
        setter = "set" + var[0].capitalize() + var[1:]
        setters.append(setter)

    for k in range(len(variables)):
        print("public " + datatypes[k] + " " + getters[k] +
            "() {\n\treturn " + variables[k] + ";\n}\n")

        print("public void " + setters[k] + "(" + datatypes[k] +
            " " + variables[k] + ") {\n\tthis." + variables[k] +
            " = " + variables[k] + ";\n}\n")

if __name__=="__main__":

    variables = ["cdf", "stdID", "section", "y"]

    datatypes = ["int", "float", "double" , "String"]

    print_getter_setter(variables, datatypes)
```

Output:

```bash
public int getCdf() {
    return cdf;
}

public void setCdf(int cdf) {
    this.cdf = cdf;
}

public float getStdID() {
    return stdID;
}

public void setStdID(float stdID) {
    this.stdID = stdID;
}

public double getSection() {
    return section;
}

public void setSection(double section) {
    this.section = section;
}

public String getY() {
    return y;
}

public void setY(String y) {
    this.y = y;
}
```

### Conclusion
In this article, we have learned what getters and setters are in the python programming language. We have also learned how to get `getters` and `setters` behavior using the `property()` function, `@Property` decorators, and finally using normal functions. 

I urge the reader to use the knowledge gained to advance into getters and setters in other languages.

Happy cording!
