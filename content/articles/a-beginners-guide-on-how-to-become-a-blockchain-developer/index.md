I'm sure many of you are sitting out there wondering whether blockchain development is for you. This might be because you might be having no prior coding experience, you're not a technologically savvy person, or you just have no idea on how you are going to be a developer.

Well, ultimately, I felt the same exact way some few years back.

While I've been introduced to technology at a young age, I didn't understand the way of thinking that came with software development. I struggled to learn at first. But in hindsight, what it really took was continuous perseverence and eventually it just clicked. This is the same case with blockchain development. It might seem like a big deal but once you get the hang of the concepts which I'll be mentioning in this article, things will click. 

In this article, I'm going to guide you on a proper way to get started with blockchain development even if you don't have any prior coding experience. 

For an introduction to the blockchain technology, please read this [article](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/building-a-simple-cryptocurrency-blockchain/). 

Let's get started!

### Who is a blockchain developer?

There are two types of blockchain developers:

1. Core blockchain developers

These developers are mainly responsible for building the back-end (main engine) of Decentralized Applications (Dapps). Examples include the Ethereum Blockchain, Bitcoin Blockchain, and Cardano Blockchain.

These developers typically write code using C++, Go, and Haskell.

2. Blockchain software developers

These developers are mainly responsible for designing and building the front-end of Dapps. Basically, the web and mobile interfaces that users interact with. Most blockchain developers fall under this category.

They mainly write code using Solidity and Javascript programming languages.

Let's use an example to explain the distinction between blockchain core developers and software developers. 

Web developers build web applications on top of web browsers. But, they don't build web browsers. The "Mozillas" of this world build the web browsers (main engine). Similarly, core blockchain developers build the "browser" (main blockchain network) while blockchain software developers build apps on top of the blockchain.

### Which blockchain should I use?

1. Bitcoin blockchain

This is the distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. 

2. Ethereum blockchain

3. Cardano blockchain

4. Binance Smart Chain

5. Solana

#### Note

Unless you have a really good reason, then you should use the Ethereum blockchain as it has the biggest developer community for building blockchain-based applications. As a developer, you wouldn't want to get stuck and not have a community to be able to ask questions.

### Libraries and frameworks for blockchain development

1. Web3.js

2. React.js

3. Ethers.js

4. Metamask

5. Node.js

6. Ganache

7. Truffle

### Which programming languages for blockchain?

1. Solidity

This is the programming language that is used for creating Ethereum smart contracts.

2. Javascript

It is used primarily for creating user interfaces. 

3. Python

4. Haskell

### Use cases for blockchain

1. Finance

#### Cryptocurrencies

Today, there exists over 5,000 cryptocurrencies. This is according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), a company that tracks cryptocurrencies market caps, rankings, prices, exchange volumes, and currency conversion. However, the most popular cyptocurrencies in this space include [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

People tend to think that cryptocurrencies are the only blockchain's use case. This is not the case. However, it is the biggest use case for blockchain. 

As a blockchain developer, you can build and launch one of your own cryptocurrency. But there is a catch. With the high number of cyptocurrencies out there, it is advisable to build and launch a coin that tries to solve real-world problems. Otherwise, it'll just exist and not be adopted by anyone. 
A good example is Cardano with their [Cardano Africa](https://africa.cardano.org/) project. They aim to use Ada (name of Cardano's cryptocurrency), to try and solve some of the financial problems currently experience in less developed countries such as accessibility to loans. This is a luxury enjoyed by many people in developed worlds. 

As a blockchain developer, you need to think along those lines.

#### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Currently, the adoption of DeFi is trending in the blockchain world. DeFi aims to replace the existing traditional finance system. It essentially takes financial products and moves them onto the blockchain ecosystem. Some few examples of these products includes savings, loans and trading.

Taking a look at the 1 year chart on [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/), you will notice how the adoption of DeFi has skyrocketed over the last few months.

Currently, most of the DeFi run on the Ethereum blockchain. Popular DeFi project in the market today include [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). Maker, Aave, and Compound are used as lending platforms, Polygon as a payment plaform, and Uniswap for decentralized exchange (DEX).

As a blockchain developer, you can build platforms such as these.

2. Supply Chain

The supply chain system involves tracking the movement of goods which end up turning into end products. Big companies such as Walmart use it to increase the supply chain transparency.

Using blockchain technology helps ensure that distributors across the supply chain are honest and transparent.

3. Digital Identity

Cardano has partnered with [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/app) to enable the issuance of digital identities and credentials that users own, control, and share easily, both securely, and privately. This will be built on the Cardano blockchain. Building it on Cardano's blockchain eliminates the need for having a third-party to offer verification services. They recently secured a deal with the Ethiopian government where they are plannig to issue over 5 million students with digital identities. Learn more about the deal [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2019/04/30/cardano-founder-launches-enterprise-blockchain-framework-in-collaboration-with-ethiopian-government/?sh=50d7424e4e10). 

As a blockchain developer, you can build digital identity systems that secure digital IDs, degrees, certificates, transcripts, examinations, and badges etc. on the blockchain.

4. Healthcare

In healthcare, blockchain can be used for record keeping & medical history tracking, patient & drug identity validation, and to offer direct healthcare service payments. This [article](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/blockchain-as-a-revolution-in-healthcare/) on Section explains clearly how the blockchain technology is used to enable these services in healthcare. 


These are a few use cases for the blockchain technology. It can also be used to secure title deeds in real estate and to secure voting systems from tamper in democratic countries.

### Wrapping Up

In this article, I have explained how you can become a blockchain developer and take advantage of this incredibly scarce and lucrative field. It is wrong to assume that just because you have no prior coding experience, that this is not for you. Blockchain development is a skill you master over time. Just follow this guide, persevere, and continuously try and practice. With blockchain development, practice makes perfect.
