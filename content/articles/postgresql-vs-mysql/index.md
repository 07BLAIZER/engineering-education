Now, more than ever, businesses need to optimize the use of digital systems to store and manage their data. The move is an integral part of ensuring risks stemming from poor data management are minimized or eradicated. Such risks may include access to inaccurate data, data loss, unauthorized access, and revenue loss.

In rare scenarios, an entity can get into trouble with the law over how it handles its data. Some laws govern the use of personal data that organizations must comply with, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/)) that is set to become the most influential data protection legislation worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to employ efficient, reliable data management systems to facilitate smooth business operations within an organization. Such systems include [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

This article will highlight the two different technologies used in data storage, MySQL and PostgreSQL. We will explore the various features that define these technologies. We will highlight the difference between the two technologies and finally conclude which is a better solution.

### An overview of PostgreSQL and MySQL

Both PostgreSQL and MySQL are free and open-source data management systems. They allow modification of source codes to accommodate the specifications and preferences of the user.

These systems make it possible for companies to develop unique digital ways of recording, accessing, transferring, and modifying data. Businesses can build safe information storage systems that conform to their set standards.

PostgreSQL, just like MySQL, is a relational data management system (RDMS). The two RDBMS store logical data separate from physical data. These are stored in tables, which are also called relations. The arrangement makes it possible for the user to manage physical data without causing any access trouble to data stored in the logical structures. A user, for example, can change the name of a stored file without altering its contents. Relational data management systems make it easier to handle multitudes of 'related' data.

PostgreSQL was first released in 1996. MySQL made its initial release a year earlier. The existence of the databases for two decades and a half has garnered impressive popularity for them. Leading tech giants and business conglomerates employ the systems in their data management. Some organizations use the two systems within their entities and subsidiaries. However, most entities prefer one of the data management systems over the other for their reasons.

### Features of PostgreSQL

A good number of operating systems are compatible with PostgreSQL. These include [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11), [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [UNIX](https://unix.org/), [Android](https://www.android.com/), and [OS X](https://www.android.com/). The RDBMS, written in [C](https://www.cprogramming.com/), boasts of programming interfaces for languages C, [C++](https://www.cprogramming.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), and [Perl](https://www.perl.org/). Other languages it supports include [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/), [Go](https://golang.org/), [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/), [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), and [Open Database Connectivity. ([ODBC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/odbc-programmer-s-reference?view=sql-server-ver15)).

Managing data for operations with heavy analysis is more accessible with PostgreSQL. It is an object-relational database, hence includes features like function overloading where one feature can do multiple tasks and inherit tables where properties of one table can be 'inherited' in another table. It also supports materialized views so that users can save a Structured Query Language (SQL) query on analysis on a disc as a physical table. This increases the order of magnitude speeds of complex SQL queries. As a result, the queries can interact more effectively with other SQL queries.

The performance of PostgreSQL was also improved by its index design. An index is basically the structure or object which helps to mainly speed up retrieval of specific data. It facilitates a comparatively quicker execution of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) activities.

The RDBMS also offers [partial, bitmap, and expression indexes](https://leopard.in.ua/2015/04/13/postgresql-indexes#.YKqrWKgzbb0). Indexes are special database objects designed to speed up data access mainly. Partial Indexes are used in situations where the need arises to only index part of a table. Bitmap indexing is used in situations where an index may return more than one result. Under expression, indexes are not built on a functional index on a table field but on an arbitrary expression. Here is the computation of the expression is costly, then more resources will be required to perform the operation

Heavy analysis with PostgreSQL feels even lighter with the wide range of triggers the system offers. These are events that set a course of action in motion. If you would like to take action on a specific database event, such as inserting or updating a record, then trigger functionality can be helpful as it invokes the required function on defined events.

PostgreSQL ensures the security of user data with a robust access control system. The RDBMS possesses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ([LDAP](https://ldap.com/)) often used for authentication and storing information about users, groups, and applications and Generic Security Service Application Program Interface ([GSSAPI](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/817-5770/whatsnew-s9fcs-113/index.html)) a security framework that enables applications to protect their transmitted data. It also brings to the table the [SCRAM-SHA-256](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sasl-authentication.html), a framework for authentication in connection-oriented protocols and the [Security Support Provider Interface](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/098759899/CHP24CHP.HTM) which provides a mechanism by which a distributed application can call one of several security providers to obtain an authenticated connection.

PostgreSQL also has disaster recovery features that include Point in Time Recovery ([PITR](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-backup-excerpt/8.0/en/point-in-time-recovery.html)), [tablespaces](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/manage-ag-tablespaces.html), and Write-Ahead Logging ([WAL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/wal-intro.html)). It also supports [Synchronous](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13739/synchronous-replication), Asynchronous and [Logical](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/logical-replication.html#:~:text=Logical%20Replication,-Table%20of%20Contents&text=Logical%20replication%20is%20a%20method,byte%2Dby%2Dbyte%20replication.) replications.

PostgreSQL is also fully ACID compliant (Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability).

### Features of MySQL

MySQL is a fast database for read-heavy data writes. It is an incredible choice for managing simple but bulk data projects. It is written in C and C++ and supports the languages C, C++ Perl, Java, [PHP](https://www.php.net/), Python, and [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/). MySQL applications can be developed on major operating systems, including [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), Symbian, [HP-UX](https://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-hpux.htm), [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/), Linux, and [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/).

MySQL supports Open Database Connectivity ([ODBC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/odbc-overview?view=sql-server-ver15)) a widely accepted application programming interface (API) for database access. With ODBC, an application can access different database management systems with the same source code.

Just like PostgreSQL, MySQL supports replication in case of a hardware change. This also makes database queries faster.

The database supports [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-introduction.html) formats, which facilitates transactions in the system. The InnoDB formats also allow the creation of InnoDB tables. MySQL supports foreign key constraints for these tables hence eliminating unwanted cross-references in linked tables.

The database is also equipped with JSON data validation, which rejects invalid JSON data from being entered into your projects.

MySQL facilitates an easier transition to a new password in codes by supporting dual passwords for the entered data. A user does not need to edit an entire application when updating the password.

Other features of MySQL include support for multi-version concurrency control, multi-threads using Kernel Threads, and huge data capability. The ANSI SQL standard database can handle rows exceeding 50 million.

# PostgreSQL vs MySQL

# Abstract

In this article we will highlight the two different technologies used in in data storage, [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). We will explore the various features that define these technologies. From this we will highlight the difference in the two technologies and finally draw a conclusion on which is a better solution. We will see that although MySQL has been widely used and has existed longer than [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), its popularity has declined over time and more users are looking for other technologies such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with more advanced features for more complicated application designs

### Conclusion

We conclude by noting that determining the better choice between the two databases depends on the user. Both PostgreSQL and MySQL get the job done with a clean finish on a primary data management level. They are both competitive data management systems with outstanding features. However, developers conversant with the two find the more popular MySQL faster and more efficient with read-heavy data writes. However, it scores under PostgreSQL on complex analytics and concurrence. While MySQL is faster, PostgreSQL is more powerful. A Google trend analysis indicates a drop in interest in MySQL over time. This is an indication that more developers are looking for alternative database management solutions from MySQL.
