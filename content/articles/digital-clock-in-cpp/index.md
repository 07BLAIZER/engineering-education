### Introduction
A `digital clock`, as opposed to an analogue clock, shows the Time digitally (in numbers or other symbols). There is a misconception that digital watches and electronic drives are synonymous. However, this is not true. The term "digital" only describes the time display, not the actual campaign itself. In this tutorial, we will be learning how to create a digital watch using the C++ programming language from the first step to the last one. Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ in 1979 while working at Bell Labs. With its mix of high-level and low-level language characteristics, C++ is known as a medium language. Since C++ is a superset of C, it's possible to write a valid C++ program.

### Prerequisites 
- Have some basic knowledge of the C++ programming language.

Check the article [Introduction to C++](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/intro-to-c-part1/) to learn more about the c++ programming language.

- Have an IDE installed. [clik here to install visualstudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> VisualStudio accepts all varieties of programming languages. That's why I recommend using it as the IDE.

### An overview of our project
To build our digital watch, we will use a c++ software that creates a digital clock. Conditions and loops are two important c++ programming concepts that we will practice here. We'll utilize the Time () function to obtain the current local time. Initializing our variables will use the "tm" structure, which contains data and time characteristics. An excellent c++ digital clock application will be built using an endless while loop.

Let's break down the digital clock software into more miniature stages to make it easier to understand and complete. These are the actions that must be taken.
- Use the Time () method to find out what Time it is right now on your machine.
- Initialize the tm structure with the hours, minutes, and seconds declarations.
- In an endless while loop, show the current time on a digital clock.
- Increase the hours, minutes, and seconds variables depending on the current situation and the input.
- Add a delay and then delete all prior times from the screen.

### Obtain the system current time
To be able to obtain the system current time, use the following procedure 
- use the time library's `time()` method in C++. It provides an object of type time t with the current Time as a value.
- Use the `local time()` method to convert a time `to identifier's reference to a tm identifier.

An identifier is a name used to identify a single thing or a single class of objects. The `object` or class may be a concept, a countable physical object, or a physical noncountable substance.

- Declare a `timePtr` tm type pointer to hold the localtime() function's result.

A pointer is a kind of object in computer programming that keeps track of a memory location. Other values in computer memory or memory-mapped devices may serve as examples of this.

- Using the `tm` structure type, we can manipulate Time by using characteristics like tm sec, tm min, tm hour, and so on.

The syntax below is used to obtain the local Time.

```c++
time_t t = time(NULL);
    tm *timePtr = localtime(&t)
```

### Utilize struct attributes
- The arrow operator may be used to retrieve the properties of `timeptr`, a pointer to a struct to object.

- Set the time sec property to the value of the sec variable you just declared.

- Initialize the variable min with the tm mim attribute before declaring another one with the same name.

- Use the tm hour property to set the hours variable to zero.

- Declare an AM/PM timestr variable.

The code below stores the local Time in the variables using the pointers, and the if condition is used to change the local Time to twelve hours clock format

```c++
    time_t t = time(NULL);
    tm *timePtr = localtime(&t);
    
    int seconds = (timePtr->tm_sec);
    int minutes = (timePtr->tm_min);
    int hrs = (timePtr->tm_hour);
    
```

### Display the digital clock
To achieve the idea of showing the user the working digital watch, I used the while loop condition. 

The procedure below gives an idea of how to output the clock.

- To construct an endless loop, use a while loop with actual instead of any condition.
- Print the variable hours, minutes, and seconds.
- To make it appear suitable, print appropriate gaps and lines.

Use the loop below

```c++
while (true)
    {
        system("cls");
        
        cout << "The digital time is:";
        
        cout << "      |" << hrs << " : " << minutes << " : " << seconds << " " << endl;
    }    
```

Since we have created our digital clock, the next step changes the Time on a Digital Clock.

### How to increment the Time 
Follow the procedure below to increment the Time in our digital watch.

- Increment the sec variable on every iteration of the while loop.

- Once the sec value reaches 60, increment the min variable by one and set the sec back to one.

- In the same way, when the min reaches 60, increment hours by one and set the min variable to 0.

- Set the hours to 00 when it reaches 24. This is because the standard Time in twenty four hours system ranges from one to twenty four repeatedly.

Use the code below to accomplish the time increment.

```c++
 while (true)
    {
        // This increases the seconds   
        sec++;
        if (seconds >= 60)
        {
            seconds = 1;
            minutes++;
        }
        // This increases the minutes
        if (minutes >= 60)
        {
            minutes = 0;
            hrs++;
        }
        // This increases the hours
        if (hrs >= 24)
        {
            hrs = 00;
        }
    }
```

After incrementing, the last step is to ask ourselves how to add delay and clear the screen simultaneously. To achieve this, we will use the steps below.

- Use `system(cls)` to remove the prior staff from view.

- To give our digital clock software some slack, we'll use the `sleep()` function.

- Add a one-second delay by entering a value of 1000.

- The window.h header has a sleep() method.

```c++
while (true)
    {
        system("cls");
        
        cout << "The digital time is:";
        
        cout << "      |" << hrs << " : " << minutes << " : " << seconds << " " << endl;
        //increment sec min and hours   
        sec++;
        if (seconds >= 60)
        {
            seconds = 1;
            minutes++;
        }
        // This increases the minutes
        if (minutes >= 60)
        {
            minutes = 0;
            hrs++;
        }
        // This increases the hours
        if (hrs > 24)
        {
            hrs = 00;
        }
    
        Sleep(1000);
    }

```

### A complete demo of our project

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>
#include <windows.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    time_t t = time(NULL);
    tm *timePtr = localtime(&t); // stores the local time of the computer.
    
    int seconds = (timePtr->tm_sec);
    int minutes = (timePtr->tm_min);
    int hrs = (timePtr->tm_hour);
    

while (true)
    {
        system("cls");
        
        cout << "The digital time is :";
        // This output the message "The digital time is :"
        
        cout << "      |" << hrs << " : " << minutes << " : " << seconds << " " << endl;
        //increment sec min and hours   
        seconds++;
        if (seconds >= 60)
        {
            seconds = 1;
            minutes++;
        }
        // This increases the minutes
        if (minutes >= 60)
        {
            minutes = 0;
            hrs++;
        }
        // This increases the hours
        if (hrs > 24)
        {
            hrs = 00;
        }
    
        Sleep(1000);
    }    

    return 0;
}
```

The output is
