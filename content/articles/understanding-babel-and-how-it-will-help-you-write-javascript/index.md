### Introduction
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that changes over `EcmaScript 5` JavaScript from the forefront to standard JavaScript. `EcmaScript 6` by Babel incorporates all of the most recent javascript elements and headways. This post will give you a prologue to Babel and tell you the best way to utilize it to make javascript simpler to compose.

### Implementation
Babel comes bundled as a hub module. Establishment, as you may expect, is through npm: 

```
$ npm install â€“ D babel-cli 
```

There are modules for webpack, swallow, snort, Sublime and Webstorm. So whatever your improvement toolchain, Babel can most likely space into it.

### Classification
JavaScript is without style. Things plunge from various articles, which implies that anything might be the parent of another. Any breaking point is a constructor limit, and summoning it with the new articulation brings something else. 

You might get more data about this in the JavaScript for Smart People course - Object Orientation segment. This is exceptionally decent and JavaScript; however, it makes some fretfulness in C# and Java plans. They are used to a level of more important carefulness, which is why ES6 presents the class articulation. This empowers us to see the imperatives that ought to be used as constructors. 

A class is an astounding example object that can be utilized to depict a wide assortment of things. This is a rare example of prototype inheritance. We confine ourselves to making things from limitations that we have explicitly decided to be used depending on the situation.

#### Classes in Babel
This is what an EcmaScript 6 class looks like:
```javascript
class User {

}
let userOne = new User
```

With a little elaboration, we get a constructor work if we run it through Babel:

```javascript
"use strict";
function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
  if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
    throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function");
  }
}
let userOne = function User() {
  _classCallCheck(this, userOne);
};
let userOne = new User();
```

We have our `UserOne` project, which serves as a standard prototype constructor. The `_classCallCheck` method adds a touch of safety testing as well.
Apart from if the `userOne` work is regarded as a constructor work, the `_classCallCheck` work is called inside the `userOne` constructor and will cause a mix-up.

### Numeric Strings
As an added bonus, EcmaScript 6 introduces a brand-new way to characterize strings. Strings with many lines can be created using the backtick image. This is very helpful for describing JavaScript format types.
- **Example**

```javascript
let temp = `
<p>
  <h4> Hi {{name}}</h4>
</p>
`
```

The following is compiled:

```javascript
let temp = "
  <p>
    <h4>Hi {{name}}</h4>
  </p>
  ";
```

### Fat Arrows
Fat arrows offers a pleasant language structure for characterizing mysterious capacities.

- **Example**
```javascript
 function (a, b) {
  return a + b
  };
```

Results to:

```javascript
((a, b)=> {
  return a + b;
});

```

This capacity has not been called.We could call it as demonstrated below: 
- **calling the function**

```javascript
let x = (a, b) => {return a + b} (4,5);
```

Gives the following:

```javascript
let x = (function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
})(4, 5);
```

### Fat bolts with a single boundary 
If we have a single border, then we can be allowed to prohibit the supports for moving ahead of the bolt:

```javascript
a => {return a + 3};
```

we get:

```javascript
(function (a) {
  return a + 3;
});
```

If our capacity contains precisely one line of code, we can exclude the wavy supports inside and out:

```javascript
a => a + 1
```

Results to:

```javascript
(function (a) {
  return a + 1;
});
```

### Further practice
One of these should be used to produce all of the array's constituents.

```javascript
let x = [12, 23, 68];
x.map(ind => alert(ind));
```

gives us:

```javascript
let x = [12, 23, 68]
x.map((ind)=>{
  return console.log(ind);
});
```

### This keyword and the Babel Fat Arrows
 In JavaScript, the watchword `this` is the article preceding the spot when the capacity is called. This is sensible, however frequently vexing, since it once in a while needs `this` to be concealed in that. Fat bolts bypass `this` by protecting the current worth of `this`.

```javascript
a = {
  b:()=>{
    () => {
      alert(this)
      }();
  }
}
```

Results to:

```javascript
a = {
 b: let b = ()=> {
   let _this = this;
    ( ()=> {
      alert(_this);
    })();
 }
};
```

The value of this has been taken care of in a variable inside the conclusion 

### Conclusion
ECMAScript 6 is glossing over-applied to the highest point of ECMAScript 5. JavaScript in the motor keeps on working as the original, list-readiness language that we are familiar with. At the point when we use ECMAScript 6, we get some pleasant accentuation that ultimately means truly plain, standard JavaScript.

A part of this sugar is expected to help the Java/C# people group, which often experiences model inheritance perplexing upon first disclosure. Some of it, like fat bolts, permits us to have a more compact, more contemporary-looking language structure while likewise expanding the helpfulness of JavaScript.
