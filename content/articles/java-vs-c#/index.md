### Introduction
Java and C# are both Object-Oriented languages used for developing Web applications, Networking applications, Database applications, Mobile applications, Video games, Service applications and so much more.

In this article, we shall look at:
- History of Java and C#
- Characteristics of Java and C#
- The basic and main differences between Java and C# interms of:
1. Syntax
2. Installation
3. Cross-platform 
4. Application

### History of Java
Java is an object-oriented programming language for developing a desktop application and web application. It needs Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run on a machine. In Java, developers can use the principle of write once, run anywhere. Java was invented in 1995 and it requires Java Development Kit to run on a machine.

### History of C#
C# is a modern Object-Oriented Programming language which is used for developing softwares of many computer systems due to its portability. C# was invented in 2002. Programs written in C# utilize the .NET Framework to run on a machine.

### Characteristics of Java
1. It is Simple - Java is simple compared to other languages.
2. It Is Object-Oriented - Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language, everything revolves around the object.
3. It is Interpreted - To execute Java programs, you'll require an interpreter. The programs
are compiled into [bytecode](https://techterms.com/definition/bytecode) which is the Java Virtual Machine code. The bytecode is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any machine with a Java interpreter(part
of Java Virtual Machine)(JVM).
4. It is Robust - This means that the Java language is reliable. No programming language assures
complete dependability. Java compilers can identify any errors that would appear during execution in other languages, thus it emphasizes early error checking.
5. It is Secure - Thias is because Java programs run inside a sandbox which is a virtual machine.
6. It is Portable - Java does not need to be recompiled to run on any platform. This is because Java is architecture-neutral, making it to be portable.

### Characteristics of C#
1. Simple - C# language is rich in sets of library functions, data types and provides a structured approach that helps to break problems into parts.
2. It Is Object-Oriented - C# is an Object-Oriented Programming language that provides all the features of Object-Oriented programming like polymorphism, data abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance.
3. It is Fast Speed- C# language is fast during its compilation and execution.
4. It is a Modern Programming Language - This is because C# provides exception handling and garbage collection.
5. It is Secure - C# language provides many built-in features and is part of .NET runtime.
6. It is portable - This is due to its ability to create software for many of computer systems.

Lets now dive into the differences between Java and C#:

### Syntax comparison
 Java and C# use the basic syntax of the C language but there are still some syntactic differences between them. Let's look at an example program for each and compare them directly.

 ### Java
 ```java
 import java.lang.*;
 class Program{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
} 
 ```
In Java,We use *(asterisk) to import all content in a [package](https://www.javatpoint.com/package). If we don't use *, we will have to import a class in the package individually.

 ### C#
```cs
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello C#!");
        }
    }
}
```
The `using` [directive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive) enables us to use types from a namespace without having to specify how they should be used in that namespace.

In C# language, to output a text, we use `Console.WriteLine()` while in Java, we use `System.out.println()`.

### Installation comparision
This is another consideration that every programmer should look at i.e the requirement of each language to run on a machine. Let's look at what each language requires for it to run on a machine.

#### Java
Java requires JDK(Java Development Kit) to run it on a machine and executes on JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Java source code is converted into bytecode which is then compiled into machine code for it to run on a machine.

#### C#
C# utilize the .NET Framework to run on a machine and executes on CLR (Common Language Runtime). C# source code is interpreted into bytecode which is then compiled into machine code by the CLR. 

### Cross-platform 
In this heading, we should ask ourselves, which of these languages is easily compatible with other platforms?. Let's answer the question.

#### Java
Java's byte code makes it extremely cross-platform i.e when a Java program is compiled, it can run on all platforms. This proves the principle of "write once, run everywhere".

#### C#
C# should improve on this feature when compared to Java. It does not run on all platforms.

### Application
In this part, we shall look at where each of these languages can be used.

#### Java
Java is efficient and good in building [highly concurrent applications](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-highly-concurrent-systems), web-based Applications, [Distributed Applications](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/applications-of-java/) and so much more.

#### C#
C# is efficient and widely used for Mobile development, Game development, and developing Desktop applications.

### Conclusion
From the comparison above, it is evident that one Language may work on one project but may not work on another different project. Thus, when choosing between Java and C#, it is important to consider the needs and requirements of the two languages.
