# Google Search Console: An Introduction
Google Search Console is a powerful tool provided by Google which lets you understand how their search crawlers see your website. It can be complicated to setup so this guide will teach you how to add a site (called a property), submit a sitemap and find and fix any errors that the crawlers may come across. If you’re new to SEO (search engine optimisation), then you can also take advantage of its tools to monitor search traffic.

## Submitting a Sitemap

A sitemap **Link to Section Sitemap article** is an XML file that details the structure of your website (how the different pages relate to each other) in a way that search engines can understand. Creating and submitting one can help Google discover pages that its crawlers have missed.

You can generate a sitemap using the free tool, [XML Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com). Just submit your website URL and download the XML file it provides.


## Fixing Crawler Errors

Helps you find issues in your mobile optimisation. Mobile crawler now default. Content too small, buttons aren’t big enough or not enough space between them. Content wider than screen (max-width) and horizontal scrolling/scroll bars. Google penalises you for it.

Issues such as pages not found **check name of error** or pages not indexed can mean your sitemap is out of date because you’ve added or deleted webpages or otherwise modified the URLs on your website. You should delete your old sitemap, generate a new one and submit it again.

## How to Redirect Your Site the Right Way (Without Losing Your Search Rankings)

Change of Address Tool. Need to verify both the old and new domain in Search Console. Permanent redirect 301 (check the number). Can either do it at the DNS level (recommended because it’s faster) or through a .htacesss file. Some hosts don’t offer permanent redirects DNS which isn’t very good.
